<h2><span class="h2line1">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span></h2>
<p>In acknowledging the sources of information and the assistance
of the many persons I consulted in the preparation of this book,
the author wishes to thank the following: The staffs of the
Sabine Parish, the Natchitoches Parish and the Northwestern
State College Libraries&mdash;with especial thanks to Miss Catherine
Bridges who so patiently and ably assisted me in gathering
data for this writing. Acknowledgment is gratefully and appreciatingly
given to those excellent authors and their publishers
listed in the bibliography at the back of this book, for it was
through their talent and efforts that a whole new experience was
opened to me.</p>
<p>I must remember too my History Teacher, Mrs. Lucille Roy
Caffery, who so thoroughly planted in my mind the desire to read
and study History, for it was she who told me, &ldquo;It is the History
and the Present which foretells the Future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I am likewise grateful to Miss Margie Harrison and Mrs.
Mabel Fletcher Harrison who corrected and typed this book and
to Mrs. Bernice A. Authur of Many, La., who also assisted in the
typing of this manuscript.</p>

<h2 id="c1"><span class="h2line1">PREFACE</span></h2>
<p>There are two ways to write the history of an area. First, the
actual-fact-data way, which gives dates, important events and the
names of the leaders. But this does not fully explain the reasons
for their occurrence, nor show the effect of mass participation.
It omits many of the names of others involved in the incident or
incidents, so that a clear picture of all the people involved is
lacking. Even while one is reading, he is conscious of a mass
effect and realizes that a sort of team is present. He then stops
and asks himself, &ldquo;Who were the others?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The second way is to combine the legends and folklore with
the actual fact-data of an area and to use reason and imagination&mdash;to
seek out the names of others connected with the adventure.
Those who went their way, but most important, those who remained
to establish, fortify and settle, and by their so doing,
give permanence and purpose to the area.</p>
<p>By using the second method, the writer believes he has given
a true history of the locality of which he writes, because he has
used the actual-fact-data of the area, and added to it the economic
and social life of the people involved, especially of those
who remained to become inhabitants.</p>
<p>To write a history of such an area as that which includes
Natchitoches, El Camino Real, Los Adais and the Neutral Strip,
one must be blessed with the knowledge of several languages,
and feel that he can comprehend the nature of the people, who
for nearly three and one half centuries have passed before him,
from the time of Cabeza De Vaca in the year 1530 to the establishment
of Fort Jesup by General Zachary Taylor in 1823. One
must specially be familiar with the Adais Indians, who were a
branch of the great Caddo Federation of Indians and their
Nation when Cabeza De Vaca visited the Adais.</p>
<p>At Los Adais an incident occurred which changed the social
life of the wilderness frontier. Two sets of Latin eyes met; in
<span class="pb" id="Page_X">X</span>
them reflected desire, passion, and love. Out of the distance,
on a pine-scented wind, came the singing voice of a Spanish
serenader, accompanied by the soft music of a string instrument,
a bright sun to cause light on shade and in the shade Spanish
and French lips met and arms entwined.</p>
<p>A half-naked savage lurks in the shadows nearby. Entranced
by the magic of this moment, he speaks and the spell is broken.
To the Senorita in Spanish and to the Frenchman in French;
&ldquo;Come, it is time to go.&rdquo; What kind of Indian is this, who speaks
both French and Spanish fluently? Only Dachiacoin of the Adais
could do this and because of it he ranged far and wide in both
the French and Spanish Territories. Dachiacoin had this to say
to Padre Certa, &ldquo;A man needs only one wife, the right one for
him, and the woman needs only one husband, the right one for
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For over fifty years Los Adais was the Capital of the Texas
Country and the end of El Camino Real. Here anything was expected
to happen and usually did.</p>
<p>El Camino Real, The Royal Road, The King&rsquo;s Highway, The
Contraband Trail, The Old San Antonio Trace, The Old Texas
Trail, and, lastly, Louisiana Highways 6 and 21 through Texas.
This Southland&rsquo;s busiest highway served the outlaw, the murderer,
the slave trader, and the priest, as well as the sinner.
Regardless of which direction one traveled he had to pass the
Adais and the Neutral Strip&mdash;this area so filled with love, hate,
jealousy, generosity, selfishness, prosperity, and despair. If at
all this be possible, then this was El Camino Real, Los Adais and
the Neutral Strip.</p>
<p class="tb"><i>Because</i>:</p>
<p>The Buffalo migrated southward through Texas and then to
Louisiana, following the same trail in the winter of each year.
Then the powerful Caddo Nation split and each group followed
a leader. The Adais came to settle along this Buffalo Trail
near Spanish Lake. El Campti originated the meeting place on
the great Sand-bar near Campti, Louisiana, so that each fall of
the year all tribes of the Caddo Confederacy could come and
trade. Francois Hidalgo desired to establish Missions and settlements
to bring more freedom and prosperity to his people and
<span class="pb" id="Page_XI">XI</span>
to bring the teaching of the Catholic Faith to all savages of the
Tejas country. He wrote a letter to the French Governor of
Louisiana, using the pretext of trade as bait.</p>
<p class="tb"><i>Results</i>:</p>
<p>The Trading Post at Natchitoches established; the Missions
established.</p>
<p>The French Post St. Jean Baptiste, the Spanish Presidio,
Del Neustra Senora del Pilar de Los Adais. Both Nations now
had to maintain these outposts to prevent encroachment from
the other.</p>
<p class="tb"><i>Effected</i>:</p>
<p>The desire of both Nations to populate this Frontier. When
Mexico won her independence from Spain the Neutral Strip was
formed. This lawless unpoliced strip of land became the back
door of the United States. Because of this ruthless lawlessness
Fort Jesup was established.</p>
<p>The independent spirit of the settlers along the El Camino
Real and their desire for freedom resulted in the establishment
of the State of Texas.</p>
<hr />
<p>As I lolled one summer&rsquo;s day beneath an oak near the
ruins of Post St. Jean Baptiste des Natchitoches and closed my
eyes to give my fancy free play, I thought I heard sounds of all
kinds, sounds that had undoubtedly resounded down the years.
Could that squealing be the swine of the De Soto adventurers or
the shriek of automobile tires coming to a braked stop? Is that
rumble I hear that of thundering herds of buffalo or the approach
of a diesel locomotive with its long train of cars? Those
drums, are they the drums of the Caddo Indians or the drums
of a marching high-school band? The whistling roar that reaches
my ears, is it a jet plane or the swishing, whistling wings of
diving ducks?</p>
<p>Awakened to reality I began the research and study that
enabled me to write this book.</p>

<br /><span class="h2line2">EL CAMINO REAL</span></h2>
<p>Each fall of the year the buffalo came out of the Great Plains
through Oklahoma and into Texas. At the Trinity River in
Texas many of these herds turned eastward to cross the Sabine
River into Louisiana, to travel ever eastward and to cross the
Red River in the Natchitoches area. The buffalo, being a heavy
beast, left a well-marked trail from the Trinity River to the
Red River in the Natchitoches area. The buffalo trail now became
part of the Caddo Indian Trail system. And later it became
El Camino Real.</p>
<p>In Spanish, the words &ldquo;El Camino Real&rdquo; mean &ldquo;The King&rsquo;s
Road.&rdquo; That is the exact translation of these words. In Spain,
even before the time of the discovery of America, there were
several roads or highways listed as El Camino Real. All roads
leading to the city in which the King of Spain resided were
known as El Camino Real. Actually, the meaning to the Spanish
people of the words &ldquo;El Camino Real&rdquo; meant <i>The Road to the
King</i>, hence El Camino Real, <i>The King&rsquo;s Road</i>. So here in
America when Mexico was conquered and settled by the
Spaniards and Mexico City came into being, expeditions were
sent out to conquer this new land for the King of Spain. In all
directions from Mexico City, Ranchos, Missions and Presidios
were established and all roads leading from these establishments
back to Mexico City&mdash;to the Viceroy, who was the direct representative
of the King&mdash;were called El Camino Real because these
roads led to the Viceroy who was actually the King and Ruler
of this New Country.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_2">2</div>
<p>This El Camino Real, which we in Louisiana and Texas are
interested in, began in Mexico City and ended at the &ldquo;Old
Darkey&rdquo; Statue, at the North end of Front Street in the City
of Natchitoches, Louisiana. Some say that El Camino Real
begins in San Antonio, Texas, and ends in Natchitoches, Louisiana.
I believe this is wrong because the very name of the
Road, &ldquo;El Camino Real, the Road to the King,&rdquo; bears out my
theory. I will explain: if one left Natchitoches (I speak of the
time when Louisiana was under Spanish domination) and wished
to go to the King by El Camino Real, or to the one who directly
represented the King in this new country, he would have had to
travel to Mexico City and there tell his troubles to the Viceroy,
the direct representative of the King of Spain. This would have
been between the years 1762 when France gave Louisiana to
Spain, and ten years later when Los Adais was abandoned and
the site of government moved to Natchitoches, thus filling in
the last gap on the Road now known as El Camino Real, (the
section of road from Los Adais near Robeline, Louisiana to
Natchitoches). Until the year 1762 Los Adais was the site of
Government of the &ldquo;Tejas,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Texas Country.&rdquo; This area
extended from the Presidio Del Norte, as the French called this
Spanish Outpost on the Rio Grande River, or El Presidio San
Juan Bautista, as it was known to the Spanish. Now, let us
pick up the traveler again who had business with the King, past
Los Adais, Nacogdoches, San Antonio, the Presidio Del Norte,
Saltillo and Queretaro and then to Mexico City and the Viceroy,
whose word was final on all matters concerning the Government
and the people, and, of course, that covered everything.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">The Caddo Federation of Indians</span></h3>
<p>The southeastern part of Oklahoma, the southwestern part
of Arkansas, the Northwestern half of Louisiana and the Northeastern
part of Texas was Caddo land, and claimed by the Caddos
as their hunting ground. The Caddos were traders and developed
trade-routes. Many of the highways of today follow the Caddo
trails of yester-year, such as El Camino Real, that portion from
the Trinity River in Texas to Natchitoches, Louisiana.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_3">3</div>
<p>When the Caddo Nations split they settled themselves as
follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. The Attaquopois, at the confluence of the Kiamechi River
and the Red River in southern Oklahoma.</p>
<p>2. The Caddoquopois or Caddo proper remained on the Red
River near Fulton, Arkansas.</p>
<p>3. The Peticaddo on Caddo Lake hear Shreveport, Louisiana.</p>
<p>4. The Koasatti near Coushatta, Louisiana.</p>
<p>5. The Destonies on Saline Bayou near Winnfield, Louisiana.</p>
<p>6. The Yatasse on Nantanchie Lake near Montgomery, Louisiana.</p>
<p>7. The Natchitoches on the Red River at Natchitoches, Louisiana.</p>
<p>8. The Adais near Robeline, Louisiana, on a large lake now
called Spanish Lake.</p>
<p>9. The Ais at San Augustine, Texas.</p>
<p>10. The Nacogdoches at Nacogdoches, Texas.</p>
<p>11. The Hasinai consisting of four tribes on the Trinity River
in Texas, referred to by the Spanish as the Tejas (some
historians classify them as Caddos. They spoke the Caddo
language).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Ais Indians had as their neighbors to the west the
Hasinai federation of Indians which was composed of four
tribes: The Nacogdoches at Nacogdoches; the Bidais, the Nasoni
and the Nabidache, the latter three were located on the Trinity
River.</p>
<p>Such was the situation when the first aliens came in contact
with the Caddos.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">4</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="h2line1">II</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">SOME EARLY HISTORY</span></h2>
<p>In his book, &ldquo;La Relacion que Dio Alvar Nunez Cabeza De Vaca
delo Acaescido unlas Indias&rdquo;, De Vaca writes in the year 1530
that &ldquo;we were among the Adayes (Adais), the others were Juan
Castillo, Andrea Dorantes and Estabancio of Azmor who was a
slave of Dorantes.&rdquo; These four survivors were of 300 of the
Panfilio Narvez expedition that went into Florida in 1528.</p>
<p>Narvez&rsquo;s expedition, beaten by the Apalache Indians, unable
to return to their ships, killed their horses, ate the meat, used
the hides to make bellows and water casks; they forged their
armor and weapons to make tools and nails, then constructed
four boats. They skirted the coasts of Alabama, Mississippi and
Louisiana, foraging for food. During a storm the boats were
wrecked, four survived to become slaves of the coastal Indians.</p>
<p>De Vaca and his companions became traders and medicine
men. Meanwhile they learned to live off the land as the Indians
did. They planned and successfully escaped.... And now they
were among the Adais seeking directions. They were the first
white men to travel westward over the Buffalo Trail. They
wandered ever westward and finally found a Spanish patrol
from Mexico.</p>
<p>De Vaca was the only one of the three hundred to return to
Spain and even before he published his book in 1542, he had
inspired the Hernando DeSoto expedition into Florida with his
story of the City of Cibola, a city built entirely of gold.</p>
<p>Hernando DeSoto, the Golden Eagle, led the next expedition
into Florida. Continuously harassed by the Appalachie tribes of
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">5</span>
Indians of the southeastern states he crossed the Mississippi and
now in the year 1540 he marched into Louisiana, pillaging, raping
and destroying. He was assisted by these trusting Lieutenants:
Don Luis Moscoso, Don Juan de Anasco, Don Baltazarde
Gallegardo, Don Juan Labillo, Don Carlos Chinquez, Juan de
Quizman, Don Vasco de Procello, and Don Diago Vasquez, and
these Captains: Espilando, Gallegardo, Maldamando, and Luis
Fuentes. The Chronnicalor, Gonzado Quadrado Charmillo de
Zafra who wrote (From the translations of B. F. French):</p>
<p>&ldquo;We marched one day west from the Rio de Cannis in all this
cold country this Wednesday, March 21, 1541, at the end of the
day we came to a place called <i>Toalli</i>. All the Indians have houses
built so, the houses are built of reeds in a manner of tules and
daubed with mud which show as a mud wall, they are very clean
and have a small door; when you shut it up and build a fire
within it is as warm as in a stove.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a></p>
<p>Don Luis De Moscoso and a scouting party traveled westward
over the buffalo trail as far as the Trinity River before returning
to the Adais.</p>
<p>For the next hundred and forty years this area was devoid
of white explorers.</p>
<p>By early 1682 Cavalier Robert de LaSalle had begun descending
the Mississippi River accompanied by Henri De Tonty, the
&ldquo;Iron Hand&rdquo;, and a party of other Frenchmen.</p>
<p>April 9, 1682, LaSalle discovered the mouth of the Mississippi
River and established a plaque there, claiming all land drained
by this river for the King of France, Louis XIII. He named this
land LOUISIANA in honor of King Louis and Queen Anna.</p>
<p>Returning up the Mississippi near a location in the Illinois
country at Starving Rock in that same year he established Fort
St. Louis and left Captain Henri De Tonty in command.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<p>LaSalle went to France and received assistance so that he
could return and establish a settlement at the mouth of the Mississippi
River. Through erroneous navigation the expedition
missed the mouth of the Mississippi River and traveled westward,
landing at Matagorda Bay, and in the Texas country
established another Fort St. Louis in 1685.</p>
<p>LaSalle, realizing that this area was not suitable for colonization,
began land excursions in an attempt to reach Canada.</p>
<p>Father Joutel&rsquo;s diary reveals that in January, 1687, he was
with LaSalle, and a scouting party, were among the Nakassa
Indians which resided on Nakassa Lake.<a class="fn" id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a></p>
<p>In 1682 at Quaerataro, Mexico, The College of the Holy Cross
was founded by Priests; Father Francois Hidalgo, Father Jose
Diaz, Father Felix Isadore Espinosa, Father Nunez, Father Antonio
de San Buenaventura Oliverez, Father Francisco Marino,
Father Juan Parez, Father DeVaca, Father Salazar, Father
Massinettes and Father Margil de Jesus, the last named, Father
Margil de Jesus, being chosen as President of the College. These
priests, so as to distinguish their work from the work of others
called themselves <i>Zatachinies</i>, their purpose being to prepare
others for frontier missionary duties. By 1684 they had succeeded
in establishing missions south of the Rio Grande.</p>
<p>The most northern Spanish presidio at that time was Fort
San Juan Bautista, located on the south bank of the Rio Grande
near present day Eagle Pass, Texas. The land of the Coahuile
Indians extended from present day San Antonio southward into
the Monte Clova-Saltillo area of Mexico. The Matagordo area
on the Gulf Coast was included in the land of the Coahuile.</p>
<p>Aside from the duties of the Spanish missions to spread the
Catholic faith, they were also, in reality, observation and trading
posts of the Spaniards. From one of these missions it was learned
from an Indian who came to trade, that other white men had
come out of the sea in large houses that floated on the waters of
the gulf and had settled on the coast land.</p>
<p>On March 20, 1689, LaSalle was assassinated by some of his
own men on a tributary of the Trinity River. Father Joutel
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
reported the men responsible for the assassination were in turn
killed by the Indians. The remnants of the party returned to
Fort St. Louis and finding it deserted, retraced their journey
into the Trinity River area.</p>
<p>Alonzo DeLeon and Captain Flores were leading a scouting
patrol when they found Santiago Grislet, Jean Lavaschevque
and two very young boys, the Tulon brothers, Roberto and Pedro.
This Spanish patrol searched for the next two months for other
Frenchmen, but not being successful, returned to Mexico.</p>
<h3>1689.</h3>
<p>Juan Jarri had, during the absence of LaSalle, deserted Fort
St. Louis and had risen to a lordly position among the tribes of
the Coahuile Indians. During the search by DeLeon and Flores
he had been shifted from tribe to tribe so that the Spanish Patrol
failed to capture him. The Spanish now realized that this one
Frenchman had the power to upset the semi-peacefulness of the
Spanish frontier. The College of the Holy Cross was desiring
to extend its Missionary work north of the Rio Grande.</p>
<p>Don Alonzo DeLeon, now the Spanish Governor of the
Coahuile Territory, led an expedition to establish three missions
among Hasinai Indians south of the Trinity River. He now also
found himself in pursuit of a party of Frenchmen (Father
Joutel&rsquo;s party).</p>
<p>Henri De Tonty at the Fort St. Louis near Starving Rock in
the Illinois country, realized something was amiss and came in
search of LaSalle. It is interesting to note how De Tonty, in all
this vast country of the southern United States area chose the
exact direction in which to travel. Probably the Caddo federation
of Indians had trade agreements with the Indian tribes as
far north as the Illinois and even further north among the
Ouisconsins, to the west they traded with the Hasinais who in
turn traded with the Coahuile Indians.</p>
<p>The Amole root (a species of the Yucca plant) was supplied
to the Hasinais by the Coahuile Indians. The Caddos traded for
this root, which had cleansing properties such as soap and when
boiled in water this liquid was used for bathing purposes, it left
a pleasant odor on the body of the user.</p>

<p class="pcap">Hinta-Sak: A home of the Adais Indians.</p>
<p class="pcapc">This drawing of a Caddo <b>hinta-sak</b>, or house, was made from the
description of an eye-witness, Gonzado Quadrado Charmillo, one of the
chroniclers of the De Soto expedition which visited the El Camino Real
area in 1540.</p>
<p class="pcapc">This Indian home was that of the Adais tribe near Robeline, La. of
the Caddo Federation. It was made of cypress poles and cane interlaced
with vines and daubed with a mixture of mud and moss. The roof was
covered with alligator skins which had been treated with bees-wax to make
it more impervious to rain. The broad leaves of the cat-tail plant were
inserted in the mud to prevent erosion from rain. Thus the Spanish
called the place <b>toai<i>l</i>le</b>, a deprecatory description of a house built of tules.

<p>The Jumas, traders of the Caddo Indians, were also linguists
and it would not have been impossible for them to distinguish
the difference of the French and Spanish languages. The same
Jumas of the Caddos traveled all of the Caddo trails. The Old
Buffalo Trail extending from the Trinity River in Texas to the
Red River in Louisiana was now considered part of the Caddo
trail system.</p>
<p>In 1690 in the early spring De Tonty, &ldquo;The Iron Hand,&rdquo;
was among the Adais Indians and the Natchitoches Indians.
He, too, went as far as the Trinity River in Texas, but there
his guides refused to go further; he gave up his search for LaSalle.
In the same year the Joutel Party found the Buffalo Trail
beginning at the Trinity River. There among the Hasinai they
learned of the Frenchman with the iron hand. They followed the
Caddo trail and finally came in contact with De Tonty among the
Arkansas Indians. Strangely enough, De Tonty actually came
within one days march of finding the Joutel Party.</p>
<h3>1690-1691</h3>
<p>From the missions south to the Trinity River came the report
of two French patrols in the vicinity of the Hainais which
also coincided with the report of Don Alonzo De Leon.</p>
<p>Late in 1690 the Don Domingo Teran Del Rios&rsquo; expedition
left Mexico, and scouted the complete area of the Caddo and
Hasinai Federations of Indians; Teran listed the four tribes of
the Hasinai as Bidia, Nabadache, Nadaco and the Nacogdoches.
Of the Caddos were the Ais, the Adais, the Natchitoches, the
Koasatas; he missed the Pedicaddo but listed the Caddoquopois
near present day Fulton, Arkansas. He was the first white
leader to sight Lake Bistineau. It is believed that the location
Father Massinetes, who was with this expedition, established
was La Mission Loretteto, near present day Ringgold, Louisiana.</p>
<p>For the reason Teran had not contacted any Frenchmen in
all the territory and much to the disappointment of the members
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
of the College of the Holy Cross, all missions north of the Rio
Grande were withdrawn.</p>
<p>Padre Francois Hidalgo, being determined to establish missions
north of the Rio Grande and among the Texas Indians,
which were called by the Spaniards the Federation of Hasinai
Indians, secured the support of the College of the Holy Cross to
appeal to the Viceroy of Mexico. They only succeeded in obtaining
permission to establish a mission at their own expense south
of the Rio Grande but in an area visited by the Hasinai Indian
traders. On November 7, 1698 Father Francois Hidalgo, assisted
by Father Salazar, established the mission Maria de Los Delores,
ten leagues north of Lampassas and ten leagues west of the Rio
Sabinas. (Note: this Sabine River is not to be confused with the
Sabine River which is the boundary between Louisiana and
Texas).</p>
<p>From this outpost mission Francois Hidalgo conceived the
idea of a &ldquo;Chain of Missions&rdquo; to extend to the very eastern edge
of the Texas Indians&rsquo; territory. He had at his disposal the reports
of Father Massinetes and those of Teran and DeLeon. He
knew that the land with its fertile soil and the enormous growth
of forests, together with an abundance of wild game of the
forests and fish of the lakes would supply many families of the
frontier settlers with food and shelter. These families, who at
this time were no better off than when they left Spain to settle
in Mexico, would welcome such an opportunity.</p>
<h3>1700</h3>
<p>From the Journal of Father Paul De Ru. February 1, to May
8, 1700.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Iberville, having founded the Fort at Biloxi, ascended the
Mississippi River. At the village of the Tensas Iberville became
ill but sent westward St. Denis and Bienville with nineteen other
Frenchmen, two of whom were the Tulon brothers, Roberto and
Piedro;<a class="fn" id="fr_3" href="#fn_3">[3]</a>
at the village of the Tensas was a Wichita Indian whose
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
tribe had settled near the Tensas.&rdquo; This Indian declared he had
visited a Spanish mission in the Texas Country (The mission
Maria de Los Delores). The Indian was immediately employed
by Bienville as a guide.</p>
<p>On April 20, 1700 the St. Denis-Bienville party reached the
Yatasee village on Nantanchie Lake near present day Montgomery,
Louisiana (See Location 5 on map).</p>
<p>The Frenchmen were among the Natchitoches Indians (Location
8 on map), on May 8, 1700 for on this day Bienville
departed with Father Paul De Ru leaving St. Denis to scout
the locations of the Caddo Indians. Bienville, having secured
pirogues from the Natchitoches Indians, returned by water down
the Red River to the Mississippi and back to Biloxi. St. Denis
soon followed and brought with him a number of the Natchitoches
Tribe of Indians, who settled on the north shore of Lake
Pontchartrain. St. Denis settled near by at Fort Louis.</p>
<h3>1701-1707</h3>
<p>During these years Father Hidalgo and Father Salazar were
trading and preaching to the Indians at Mission Maria de Los
Delores. Father Hidalgo traded with the Indians for gold; Anya,
who was then the Governor of Coahuile, was aware of this.
There are several historical records referring to the raiding
of the Hidalgo mission in search of gold. Hidalgo at first did
turn the gold over to the government, part of which was to be
given to the College of the Holy Cross. A Captain Hernandez
was broken in rank when he gave Hidalgo a receipt for the gold.
Padre Hidalgo realized that very little, if any, of the gold was
reaching the King of Spain.</p>
<p>Anya conceived the idea of cutting off the supplies of trade
goods to the mission so that the Indians would then have to come
and trade at the Presidio San Juan Bautista. Captain Hernandez
upon the urgence of the Priests of the College was restored to
rank. Father Hidalgo, realizing that no one would actually know
how much gold he was accumulating, began to hoard the gold.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>Allarge Bejoux, operating from a location near present day
Pointe Coupee, had cut a road or trail overland northwestward
to intersect the Buffalo Trail west of the present town of Many,
Louisiana, and had by the year 1708 established trade agreements
for horses with the Ais Indians (See Location 10 on map).
Francois Hidalgo through his trade with the Indians of different
tribes soon learned of this.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">A Legend of the Flores Family</span></h3>
<p>Hidalgo and Salazar with assistance had solicited the aid
of the Flores families of Saltillo, some of whom were merchants
and others owners of landed estates. The merchants supplied the
mission de Los Delores with trade supplies.</p>
<p>Through Bernardino, Sub-chief of the Hasinai Indians,
Hidalgo learned of a meeting place called Campti, where each
Fall of every year all of the tribes of the Caddo Federation of
Indians gathered for sports and trading purposes. (Campti was
the name of the Chief of the Natchitoches tribe who had organized
this meeting, held on a great sand-bar near present-day
Campti, Louisiana). These meetings were of a secret nature and
not sanctioned by the Spanish Government, and the tradition of
their occurrence had remained with the Flores family. Hidalgo
prevailed on the Flores family, who knew the value of land and
what it could produce for settlers, to assist him by sending men
to go on a trading expedition to the Campti. Bernardino was
to act as guide.</p>
<p>Ramone Flores and a cousin, Joseph Colliea, were designated
by the elder Flores to go and assist the Spanish priests. These
two made four trips in the Fall of the years 1708, 1709, 1710
and 1711 to the Sand-bar near <i>Campti, Louisiana</i>.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">The Letter</span></h3>
<p>Francois Hidalgo committed an action which might well be
considered treason by the Spanish Government. He wrote three
letters of the same content, all dated January 17, 1711, addressed
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
to the Governor of Louisiana. Only one reached its destination.
In mid-summer of 1713 the Governor of Louisiana, La Mothe
de Cadillac, had the letter in his possession. (There is always
an incident in history which incites a chain reaction in such a
way that a new era begins, always resulting in the establishment
of new frontiers. The Hidalgo letter was such an incident).</p>
<p>One must surmise how such a letter could travel through
nearly a thousand miles of wilderness and reach its destination.
The whole new frontier of El Camino Real hinged on this accomplishment.</p>
<p>The contents of the letter showed that Father Hidalgo had
first-hand knowledge of the land of the Hasinai and the Caddos
as well as the waterways of the adjoining area. He wrote that
the French traders were to ascend the Mississippi to the confluence
of the Red River, then ascend the Red River to the tribe of
the Natchitoches Indians, thence to travel westward over the
Buffalo Trail to the Hasinai Indians and there procure guides
to the Hidalgo Mission.</p>
<p>Father Hidalgo could have acquired knowledge of the Caddo
area from the reports of De Leon, Teran and Father Massinetes,
but he would have not had the knowledge of the waterways,
which could have only been obtained from the Natchitoches
Indians who may have come to the Campti from their location
on the north shore of Lake Pontchartrain; information was
given to Flores and Colliea and passed on to Hidalgo.</p>
<p>The letter was an invitation &ldquo;to come and trade&rdquo; with the
Hidalgo mission, the word &ldquo;trade&rdquo; being used as bait could have
come from two sources, that of Bejoux to the Ais and that of
Flores and Colliea. It is possible that Hidalgo wrote the letters
very early in the year so that one could be sent to the Ais Tribe
ahead of the arrival of Allarge Bejoux. The later two letters
were carried in the Fall of the year by Flores and Colliea, who
in turn gave the letters directly to a Natchitoches Indian who
had come to the Campti, but who was living on the north shore
of Lake Pontchartrain. Several historians say that St. Denis had
the letter in his possession before it was presented to Governor
Cadillac. St. Denis through his association with the Natchitoches
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
Indians, who were settled near his Fort Louis, would have been
the most logical Frenchman to receive the letter. Then, too,
St. Denis, while vying with Cadillac to be sent as the leader on
the trading expedition to the Hidalgo mission, had stated that
he and Jules Lambert, who was at that time in the Illinois
country, had been on a trading trip to the Natchitoches Indians
in the summers of 1710 and 1712. Here, then, is another possibility
that St. Denis may have received the first letter sent by
Francois Hidalgo by an Indian messenger to the Ais, and who
was instructed to give the letter to the first Frenchman who
came to trade in his area.</p>
<p>The letter had the desired effect; St. Denis was appointed
to lead the expedition. Cadillac chose wisely because St. Denis
was an educated man, and was a third generation Canadian and,
further, he understood the ways of the Indians. He was a linguist
and could speak many Indian dialects, and also speak, read and
write in Spanish.</p>
<p>The trading expedition, consisting of Indians of the Natchitoches
tribe, left Biloxi in mid October, 1713. Among the Indians
were the White Chief, his son, Koanan, and two daughters, one
called <i>Quilchil</i>, &ldquo;the pretty weaver,&rdquo; and the other called <i>Olchogonime</i>,
&ldquo;the good girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Jean Penicaut narrative is an actual eye witness account
of St. Denis&rsquo; journey to Natchitoches and on to Mexico. The
party consisted of nearly forty Indians and twenty-three Frenchmen,
two of whom were St. Denis and Penicaut, and several
French traders, Pierre Largen, Jean Lagross, Roberto Talon,
Pedro Talon, Lafrinaries, Allarge Bejoux, Labinaries, Enrique
Lantillac; Medar Jalot, who was valet and doctor to St. Denis;
the two Barberousse brothers were hunters for the party&rsquo;s food;
<i>Rambin</i> was a tailor. Soldiers in the party included Lt. Phillippe
Blondell, De Lery, De Muy, Williard Anvillaries, De Beaulieux,
De Voixant, Frainbouis, and Lavasseur, who was also a map
maker.</p>
<p>Leaving Biloxi, the party traveled what was then known as
the Iberville passage, crossing Lake Pontchartrain and through
Manchac Pass to Lake Maurepas, then into Manchac Bayou and
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
a short portage to the Mississippi River; ascending the Mississippi
to the confluence of the Red River at Baton Rouge, then
ascending the Red River to a point opposite the present day town
of Colfax. Here the stream divided and Penicaut wrote, &ldquo;we
took the left and larger branch of water.&rdquo; After some distance
upstream he describes the Ecore de La Croix, which must have
been the high bluffs near Chopin, Louisiana.</p>
<p>On November 25, 1713, the St. Denis party arrived among
the Natchitoches Indians, living on an island that the river
formed by dividing into two branches and flowing around it.</p>
<p>St. Denis spent the first few weeks cultivating the friendship
of the Indians. Trade was vigorous and profitable, he sent at
least twice back to Biloxi for more trade goods. He had traveled
at least once as far as the settlement of the Nacogdoches Indians
before deciding on an exact location for a trading post. In early
Spring of the following year two block houses were erected in
the Natchitoches Village, one to store the merchandise and the
other to house the ten Frenchmen who were to remain in Natchitoches
while the others went west in search of the Hidalgo mission.</p>
<p>While St. Denis was among the Hasinai Indians, an incident
happened which causes one to wonder at the foresightedness of
Francois Hidalgo. Among the Indians was an Indian maid named
Angelica who had received instructions at a Spanish mission
and who spoke Spanish fluently. She became the interpreter
between St. Denis and Bernardino, Chief of the Hasinai. Bernardino,
with some of the members of his tribe, acted as guide,
for St. Denis, but instead of bringing the Frenchmen to the
Hidalgo mission, they were led to Presidio San Juan Bautista
on the south bank of the Rio Grande River on July 19, 1714.
Surely these Indians would have known where the Hidalgo mission
was located; the leading of the Frenchmen to the Spanish
post was just as Hidalgo would have wished, or planned.</p>

<p>There was quite an uproar at Post Du Nord, as the French
called the Presidio San Juan Bautista. The French trade-goods
were confiscated, and St. Denis was confined to the area inside
the presidio. Somehow St. Denis found out about the plans of
the Spanish priests to establish missions to the east, and sent
word back to Bienville. The Frenchman knew that very often
presidios followed the establishments of missions. Bienville was
informed by St. Denis that this land belonged to the French.</p>
<p>Claud De Tisne was dispatched to Natchitoches to build a
Fort in 1716, Post St. Jean Baptista Des Natchitoches, naming
the post after the title given by St. Denis when the two block
houses were built in the spring of 1714.</p>
<p>St. Denis remained in the custody of the Spanish from 1714
until February 17, 1716, when he arrived at Presidio San Juan
Bautista. When the Don Domingo Ramone expedition left Saltillo,
Mexico, St. Denis was selected as guide, along with several
other Frenchmen, Medar Jalot, the two Talon brothers, Pierre
Largen and Jean Lagross. The other Frenchmen who were with
St. Denis had previously returned to Natchitoches, undoubtedly
carrying messages for St. Denis. Medar Jalot declared later that
he had delivered messages four times for St. Denis, thus the
French had been kept well informed of the goings-on of the
Spanish.</p>
<p>St. Denis while on this adventure married a Spanish wife,
Manuella Sanchez Ramone, daughter of the Alverez, Don Diego
Ramone at the Spanish Presidio. He left her at the presidio,
which was also her home, and returned to Natchitoches.</p>
<p>The Ramone expedition established the following Missions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>San Francisco de Los Delores on the Neches River, La
Purisima Conception on the Angelina River, Mission San
Jose, North of Nacogdoches, and Mission Neustra Senora
de Guadelupe at Nacogdoches.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All of these were established in 1716.</p>

<p class="pcap">LA PRESIDIO NUESTRA SENORA DE LOS DELORES</p>
<p class="pcapc">La Presidio Nuestra Senora de Los Delores was erected by
Domingo Ramone in the summer of 1716. It was later repaired
by the Marquis De Aguayo in 1722. The plan of the
fort is the work of Aguayo. The fort overlooked Los Torres,
or Mill Creek, near the intersection of the lower Douglas
Road and the road from Douglas to Wells just west of Nacogdoches,
Texas. This presidio was erected and garrisoned to
protect the three Missions in the near Nacogdoches vicinity.</p>
<p class="pcapc">La Presidio Nuestra Senora de Los Delores was abandoned
in 1731. (Drawing by the author).</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>In 1717 father Margil de Jesus and Father Francois Hidalgo
established two missions further to the east, La Mission Nuestra
de Los Delores among the Ais Indians, near the present day city
of San Augustine, Texas, and on the first day of St. Michael the
Archangel, September 29, 1717 established La Mission de San
Miguel Cuellar de Los Adais, among the Adais Indians, one mile
north of present Robeline, Louisiana.</p>
<p>At this moment Father Francois Hidalgo&rsquo;s vision had come
into being&mdash;after twenty-five years of dreaming, he had established
his chain of missions to the very end of the Texas Country.</p>
<p>With the establishment of this last mission among the Adais
Indians just fifteen miles away from the French post at Natchitoches,
both the French and Spanish realized that each must
maintain settlements so as to hold the territories thus far gained.</p>
<p>War broke out between France and Spain in 1719 and in that
same year Phillipe Blondell from the French post among the
Natchitoches Indians, raided the mission among the Adais and
allowed one prisoner to escape after making known to him that
the French were coming in multitudes to drive the Spanish back.
This caused a withdrawal of all Spanish Missions in the Texas
area as far as San Antonio.</p>
<p>Every country has its &ldquo;man of the minute&rdquo;, and this country
of New Spain was no exception. He offered his wealth and
abilities to restore the Texas missions and to re-occupy the Texas
country. The new governor of Coahuile and the Texas region
was the Marquis de San Miguel de Aguayo, his title was Don
Joseph de Alzar, Knight Commandante de Aragon, Governor
and Captain General of the Provinces of Texas-New Phillippines
and of Coahuile, New Kingdom of Estrandura&mdash;and he had
earned every one.</p>

<p>By the middle of October, 1720, the Aguayo expedition was
well on its way to the Los Adais area, with three thousand nine
hundred fifty horses and six hundred mules, loaded with powder,
shot, food, clothing and six cannons, five hundred eighty-four
men <i>AND</i> two hundred thousand piastres to build presidios on
the frontier.</p>
<p>Aguayo, while en-route to Los Adais, received word the war
between France and Spain had ended and there would be no war
on the frontier, never the less, Aguayo established the missions
and the Presidio San Antonio de Bexar at San Antonio. At the
tribe of the Adais he began proceedings to establish a presidio
there. France, too, had their &ldquo;man of the minute&rdquo; in the person
of St. Denis.</p>

<p>With St. Denis came the balance of power, which is necessary
on any frontier. The Spanish had the French out-numbered ten
to one, but they also knew that the tribes of the Caddo Federation
favored St. Denis and the French. The gold piasters were
of special attraction, as they would have been in any locality,
to St. Denis, who was an accomplished trader. Aguayo was quick
to realize that the Spanish must trade with the French for food
and their very existence. He turned a deaf ear to Captain Reynaud,
St. Denis and Bienville, who was now the Governor of
Louisiana, and their protests concerning the building of a presidio
at Los Adais, and on October 12, 1721 celebrated the rebuilding
of the mission. On November 1st in the same year was
celebrated the re-establishment of La Presidio de Nuestra Senora
del Pilar de Los Adais&mdash;the Presidio housing the Governor of
all the province of Texas.</p>
<p>In 1722 St. Denis was made Post Commandante of Fort St.
Jean Baptiste des Natchitoches and all of the Red River Territory.</p>

This Spanish Fort was erected in the shape of a hexagon. Aguayo had
six cannons and building the Fort in this shape permitted the greatest
amount of cannon fire in all directions. One will notice that on the hilltop,
the site of this Spanish presidio, several hundred yards in all directions
there is an absence of large trees and that those that are growing
are second and third-growth trees. The reason is that Aguayo followed the
same methods a trained military officer would have done. He would have
cleared the Land of all trees and undergrowth for at least three hundred
yards in all directions, so that should an attack occur, the enemy would
not have the benefit of any kind of natural cover. The shoulder guns of
that period had a fairly accurate killing effect for a distance of 150
yards. Therefore the Musketeer in the presidio would have some extra
150 yards in which to sight the enemy, take aim and fire. This presidio
is unique in this respect: It stood for nearly fifty years as a frontier
command-post and never once had to defend itself.</p>
<p class="pcapc">This plan of the Presidio at Los Adais, showing the effectiveness of
a hexagon shaped fort with cannon spaced to give the maximum protection
to the fort, was submitted to Aguayo to his superiors at Mexico City
in 1722.</p>
<p class="pcapc">The Presidio Nuestra Senora del Pilar de Los Adais has a very unique
history, it stood guarding a frontier against another nation and among the
Indians, who were at that time, considered savages, for nearly fifty years,
yet this fort never had to defend itself against any hostile demonstration.</p>

<p>Pierre Largen was trading among the Peticaddos and the
Caddoquopois.</p>
<p>La Petit was among the Peticaddos on Caddo Lake near
Shreveport, he had the year previously established a trading
post there.</p>
<p>Jean Lagross, who had also married an Ais maiden, had a
trading post among the Ais Indians on the Angelena River near
the present town of San Augustine, Texas. He was not molested
by the Spanish because of the marriage he was considered a
member of the Caddos of which the Ais was a tribe.</p>
<p>In 1723 St. Denis sent Lieutenant Antoine Layassard to
establish Post Du Rapides near present Alexandria. The year
previously LaPerrier and his two daughters had been assassinated
at the rapids portage by a band of roving Indians, and
Post Du Rapides was established to protect travelers en-route
to Post des Natchitoches.</p>
<p>In this same year, 1723 St. Denis received reinforcements,
Doctor Alexander, Lt. Basset, Lt. Renault de Hautrive and Paul
Muller. Michael Robin, a Notary for the Company of the West
was also in the group.</p>
<p>Augayo, tiring of the frontier, left for the interior of Mexico.
He appointed as Lieutenant Governor of Los Adais, Lieutenant
of the King, Almazon, who immediately set up a new trade restriction,
forbidding fraternalization and trading of any sort
with the French. It was during the tenure of Almazon that a
land grant was issued to Juan Sanchez comprising one square
league of land (the grant was an area now consisting of high
ground astraddle Toplecot Creek in the Allen area between
Robeline and Powhattan, Louisiana). Almazon allotted land to
Cadet Chacon. There was also land allotted for the support of
the Adais mission called Rancho Bano. Manuel Guiterez, who
had wed Maria Garcia, also received an allotted land grant. The
last three allotments of land were in the immediate Robeline
township area.</p>
<p>St. Denis could see permanence in this establishment of farms
in the Adais area. The presidio there now had a fighting force
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
of one hundred men-at-arms, many of which were well-mounted
and excellent cavalry men. He could to a certain extent visualize
a self supporting Spanish frontier if the farmers&rsquo; production of
crops were successful. The Spanish would need only slight assistance
from the Indian farmers with the sale of their produce to
the Spanish.</p>
<p>St. Denis retaliated by inviting all of the chiefs of the Caddo
tribes of Indians to come to the Post St. Jean Baptiste to receive
presents, knowing that all of the chiefs would bring their
families and a number of followers and that many would have
to pass the Spanish presidios on their way to Natchitoches. He
was successful in working out a trade agreement with all of the
tribes to buy their entire surplus food supply.</p>
<p>This alliance of the Caddo federation with the French restored
the balance of power on the Spanish-French frontier. St.
Denis assured the Caddo chiefs that each year such presents
would be available as long as the alliance was kept.</p>
<p>This one move by St. Denis brought safety to the French of
the area. Thus any unpleasantness which arose thereafter was
confined to verbal statements or letter writing.</p>

<br /><span class="h2line2">DACHICOIN&mdash;A NOBLE INDIAN</span>
<br /><span class="h2line3">LOS ADAIS, 1723</span></h2>
<p>Dachicoin had only two years before he reached the considered
age of an adult, which according to the Adais law was sixteen.
He had ignited the council-fire of the Adais and was demanding
audience. The Elders came and seated themselves in their proper
places and bade him speak.</p>
<p>He brought to the attention of the Adais how nice the Spanish
or French treated an Indian of position in any Indian tribe&mdash;they
dared not molest this Indian or any of his family. Also,
the Indian of position seemed to get a better deal in the matter
of trade-goods. &ldquo;If we make all the Indian adult males of the
Adais an officer or man of position then the whole tribe will
benefit by it. I wish first to test this and, if I am successful,
then I demand to be made a <i>conachas</i>&rdquo;.<a class="fn" id="fr_4" href="#fn_4">[4]</a> Dachicoin explained
his proposed test to the Elders.</p>
<p>Dachicoin went to the Natchitoches Post and demanded of
Sieur Barme, a merchant of certain trade-goods, a supply of
such goods, saying that he would bring all the profit back to
the merchant in return for which he expected something that
he could trade for himself at profit. Sieur Barme saw possibilities
in Dachicoin because he agreed to the Indian&rsquo;s terms.
Sieur Barme did not overlook the fact that the Indian spoke to
him in French. Later he found out that the Indian also spoke
Spanish. Dachicoin was made a <i>conachas</i> among the Adais.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>When Dachicoin was fifteen years old the Spanish priests
came to the Adais. Even at this young age he must have realized
that a new way of life was beginning among the Adais, and
decided to follow the new trend by working with the Spanish
priests, guiding them among the tribes of the Caddos and commuting
back and forth with them to the Natchitoches post. Soon
he mastered the Spanish language. When he was sixteen and
had successfully filled the agreement of his first test with Sieur
Barme, the Natchitoches merchant, three other men, Lotbotiniere,
Lagross and Largen, saw the possibility of profit in the
use of Dachicoin. One or the other of these traders was continuously
traveling back and forth to the Hasinai Indians who
lived deep in the Tejas Country. So Dachicoin began a tutorship
with the traders, and at the same time began to master the
French language.</p>
<p>In 1719 Dachicoin, because he could understand French, heard
of the salt shortage at the new post at New Orleans. By this
time the young Indian trader had acquired five horses as his
part of profit while trading with the Hasinai Indians. He went
to Sieur Barme and asked for ten knives, explaining that he
wished to trade the knives to the Destonies for salt, this salt
would be taken to New Orleans and traded for more knives
which would be returned to Sieur Barme. He would replace the
ten knives and the other remaining knives would be divided
equally between himself and the merchant. He would leave two
horses with Sieur Barme as security. Dachicoin then went to
Largen, who had dug-out canoes. He wished use of the largest
one, explaining his intention to Largen, and leaving one of his
horses with him as security. In return for the use of the canoe
Dachicoin would take some of Largen&rsquo;s merchandise of furs to
New Orleans and trade the furs for knives, all Largen needed
to do was to say how many knives he expected in trade for the
furs&mdash;of course this service would be free for the use of the
boat. The Indian then went to Lieutenant Blondell, the Post
Commandante, and told him his intentions, wondering if the
officer had letters he wished to be delivered to his French superiors,
saying that he would deliver the letters which at the
<span class="pb" id="Page_35">35</span>
same time would explain to the officials at New Orleans that
Dachicoin was a high-ranking Indian of the Adais tribe. &ldquo;This
will be important in my getting a fairer trade for salt and other
merchandise&rdquo;, he said. &ldquo;I would also like for you to request
Quitlami, Son of Koanan, who is called the White Chief of the
Natchitoches Indians by the French, to insure safe passage
among the Indians I might encounter because Quitlami will have
the arm band of the Son of a Chief and I the arm band of a
conachas of the Adais. These marks of distinction will be observed
by those tribes who are not on friendly terms with the
French, but who would not wish to arouse an undesirable antagonism
between two tribes such as the Adais and the Natchitoches.
The letters will safe-guard us from white men who might be inclined
to forget the <i>calumet</i> of the French and the Caddos of
whose Federacy we are members. For this service I will expect
a French soldier&rsquo;s coat, one of the things I most desire in life. I
will leave two horses at your disposal as a guarantee of my return
and my true intention to serve the French. Because of my
association with the Caddo Federacy I can be of many uses to
the French.&rdquo; The Commandant was no fool. He quickly realized
the importance of Dachicoin, and agreed to his wishes even paying
Quitlami&rsquo;s expenses in the form of presents from the company
merchandise.</p>
<p>To the average reader it would seem that Dachicoin was
risking five horses which were of more value on this frontier
than the supposed profits of this particular trading trip, but
Quitlami revealed to Lotbotiniere that Dachicoin distributed
these horses in good hands and those people were obligated to
take as good care of them as if the horses belonged to them.
Thus Dachicoin was assured of the good care of his animals with
no expense to himself.</p>
<p>The canoe or dug-out of Largen was a four-place canoe,
which is a boat that required four men to paddle it and would at
the same time, besides the human cargo, carry fourteen hundred
pounds of freight. Thus equipped Dachicoin and Quitlami set
out from Natchitoches to the Distonies on Saline Bayou in Natchitoches
Parish, where he traded five of the knives for two hundred
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
gourds of salt, each gourd contained approximately one
pound of salt. From Natchitoches he carried the furs of Largen
and small gourds of finely chopped matot, ground leaves of the
Sassafras tree. This spice was an excellent trade goods of the
Natchitoches tribe. The spice, however, was sent by Blondell and
was to be exchanged for some personal things for the Commandant.
He did, however, pay for Dachicoin&rsquo;s coat out of his own
merchandise. Because of the success of the trading trip Dachicoin&rsquo;s
name became popular along the frontier. His character
was such, that his word was his bond. He never bought any trade
goods outright to sell them for a profit as did the French traders.
Always he asked for goods on consignment. It was a familiar
sight at Natchitoches and at Los Adais to see Dachicoin arrange
what he had received for a consignment into three piles&mdash;one
pile represented the cost of trade goods and one the profits. The
one who supplied the merchandise could take his choice of two
of the piles, the other went to Dachicoin for his labors.</p>
<p>Dachicoin had taken for his wife, a squaw of the Hasinai
said to be a daughter of Bernardino, Chief of that tribe. Upon
returning to the Adais, Dachicoin spoke to Largen, who was at
the time at the Adais, explaining to him that he wished to be
blessed in marriage by a priest just as white men and women
were when priests married them. Largen explained to Dachicoin
that if he were married by the Church it would be contrary
to the beliefs of the Caddos. (The Caddos believed in separations
or divorce&mdash;that a squaw or man being dissatisfied could separate,
the squaw taking the male children and the man the female
children. These separations occurred quite often among the different
tribes of the Caddos.) At this Dachicoin replied, &ldquo;A man
will have need for only one woman if she is the correct woman
for him and a woman needs only one man if he is the correct man
for her, my squaw and I understand these things and I, Dachicoin
say that it can be no other way.&rdquo; Pierre Largen sponsored
the wedding at the Los Adais Church. It is said that Father
Margil De Jesus performed the ceremony.</p>
<p>The squaw, or shall I say wife of Dachicoin, was allowed
by her husband to ride a horse instead of walking as most Indians
<span class="pb" id="Page_37">37</span>
required their squaws to do, and, not only that, but to add to
her comfort she was seated on a good Spanish saddle, and even
had a pack horse to carry such things that a squaw was required
to carry. This caused much dissatisfaction among the other
squaws and the Indian men alike.</p>
<p>Dachicoin lit the Council Fire of the Adais and when enough
of the tribe had gathered, spoke to them. &ldquo;You of the Adais are
cooking in metal pots that I, Dachicoin gave to you. Because all
that I have also belongs to my squaw, then she too gave the pots&rdquo;.
There was no one to criticize her then, for it is a law of the
Caddos that no other person can be concerned in the private
affairs of a Caddo family unless invited to do so. If one violates
this law then he is to be punished by the elders. &ldquo;If there are
any more envious remarks about my squaw I shall see that the
law is fulfilled. What I have said shall now be forgotten, it must
not occur again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the Natchitoches council fire he berated the Natchitoches
in much the same way. Such was the power of Dachicoin that he
could demand the obedience of two tribes of Indians.</p>
<p>In 1722 St. Denis returned to Natchitoches replacing Captain
Reynaud as Commandante. He, too, was quick to learn the importance
of Dachicoin.</p>
<p>In 1723 St. Denis received a demand from Bernardino of the
Hasinai for the ransom of a Frenchman. He then sent the small,
tin box containing papers of the French officer. St. Denis recognized
the name of the officer, a man who once had fought a duel
with him. This French officer, Belle-Isle, with St. Denis had
attended the Royal School in Paris. They had always seemed to
be at odds with each other, and now St. Denis was being asked to
pay ransom for him. But St. Denis was not one to hold a grudge,
and he knew that Belle-Isle had the makings of a good French
officer. He could not bring himself to believe that there was a
possibility of Belle-Isle being a deserter and had somehow become
a slave of the Indians. Too, he realized the possibility of
the Spanish rescuing him, and from gratitude Belle-Isle might
have been inclined to offer his services to Spain. St. Denis personally
knew French officers in the service of Spain, but now
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">38</span>
he had the problem of going behind the Spanish Fort at Los
Adais to rescue Belle-Isle.</p>
<p>St. Denis sent for Quitlami and had him go to the Adais and
bring Dachicoin back with him. When the two Indians returned
he sent for Lagross, Largen and Lobotiniere for a conference. All
were given the details about Belle-Isle.</p>
<p>The ransom was to be ten French rifles with 100 shots and
enough powder to fire those 100 shots for each rifle. This was
an impractical and dangerous form of ransom because if the
party delivering the rifles should be intercepted by the Spanish
they would have grounds to think that the French were trying
to supply the Indians with fire arms to be used against them,
which could create a disastrous incident on the frontier.</p>
<p>Dachicoin asked if he might speak, and without waiting for
a reply, asked St. Denis if he would settle with Bernardino for
two rifles and the requested powder and shot. St. Denis would
be glad to agree to such a settlement, but continued Dachicoin,
&ldquo;why not turn this trip for ransom into profit?&rdquo;, which caused
a raising of eyebrows. All those present were traders and the
word &ldquo;profit&rdquo; was music to their ears. Dachicoin explained,
&ldquo;Bernardino is a trader and a clever one, and also the father
of my squaw. If I go as a member of the ransom party my squaw
must also go as she will wish to see her father again. Also this
party will need someone to cook for them, she can do that.
Bernardino has sent five of his braves and ten extra horses. He
fully expects each of those ten extra horses to have something
on them. We must send five men to accompany the Hasinais;
to send less would show carelessness, to send more would show
we were afraid, five men to ride five of the horses sent by Bernardino.
We must fix a box of wood the size of one which would
contain ten rifles, but instead of rifles it will contain lengths of
cane filled with the seeds of watermelons, squash, gourds, corn
and beans. The Hasinais are farmers, but because they move
around for place to place, staying in one place only long enough
to raise and harvest a crop; they are often short of seed, we will
also send salt, honey, pecans, hickory nuts, walnuts; these are
the things that we have plenty of. In return we will ask for the
<span class="pb" id="Page_39">39</span>
Frenchman and horses and some amole root.<a class="fn" id="fr_5" href="#fn_5">[5]</a> The last two things
are the cheapest trade-goods of the Hasinais. Bernardino has
often admired my French coat and has often tried to trade me
for it, but I explained to him that it would be too small for him.
If M. Rambin can make a coat the size of the one that would fit
M. Largen, then Bernardino would try to trade for it especially
if Largen pretends he does not wish to trade for the coat.
We will have to explain to Bernardino that we have no extra
rifles available but the one I am carrying. The other rifle mentioned
will be given to me when I return as payment for my
assistance in this trip. My squaw will have among the things
necessary for her to take some of the knives from the company
store, each of us will also have some knives to trade. We will
trade for horses and the amole root and anything else that Bernardino
has. Quitlami must tell Bernardino that the coat that M.
Largen is wearing is magic and is Largen&rsquo;s trading coat. That
when Largen has it on he always makes more profit on his
trades. That it would be a great service to the Natchitoches and
the Adais if Bernardino could trade Largen out of the coat. So
far no one has been able to do this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The trip from Natchitoches to the Hasinais was roughly
about 360 miles.</p>
<p>Immediately on the arrival of the party Bernardino brought
the slave Belle-Isle forward and demanded the rifles when he was
told that there was only one rifle and it belonged to Dachicoin.
He was furious and threatened to kill the slave on the spot.
Dachicoin explained that there were many other trade goods of
value and things that the Hasinais needed. Largen was not then
wearing the coat made by Rambin the tailor.</p>
<p>In true Caddo fashion Bernardino either spit upon or kicked
the trade goods offered for Belle-Isle (this was characteristic of
the Caddos, any trade goods was treated in such a way as to
cheapen it in the eyes of the one offering it for trade. Those
things that they wanted most they spurned the most). Each time
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
Bernardino spit on the trade goods, Largen in turn spit upon
Belle-Isle, meanwhile telling him in French that this was necessary.
Largen picked up a bundle and went into the Hinta-sak of
Bernardino. Quickly Quitlami went to Bernardino and explained
to him about the coat of Largen. When Largen came back he
was strutting and showing off the coat. He explained the designs
on the coat, the hawk on one side was an emblem of the Caddos.
He was a Caddo because he had taken an Ais Squaw. The Fleur
De Lys because he was also French. Twenty buttons, more buttons
than on any French or Spanish officer&rsquo;s coat (Rambin had
surely done his best work here). Bernardino began wanting
to trade for the coat but Largen would hear none of it. Finally
Bernardino offered the slave for the coat and explaining that if
the slave was a Frenchman and Largen was a Frenchman then
they were brothers&mdash;surely a brother would give a coat to save
his brother&rsquo;s life and if they did not come to an agreement about
the coat then the slave was sure to die. Largen then surprised
Bernardino by saying he would give the coat if the Chief would
given ten horses to the slave and ten horses to him and then
trade horses for the other trade goods along with the amole root
and some wolf hides. This Bernardino agreed to.</p>
<p>St. Denis was awakened by the sound of thundering hooves.
Lobotiniere called to him. St. Denis wiped his eyes as he witnessed
the success of the trip&mdash;eighty horses, many of them loaded
with hides and other merchandise.</p>
<p>After all settlements were made among those who participated
on the trip, Belle-Isle told St. Denis of his misfortune. The
ship he was on left France in 1718. After they had entered the
Gulf of Mexico a storm came up and the ship was blown off
course. Then scurvy broke out aboard ship. Finally land was
sighted. The ship&rsquo;s captain, believing that the ship was at a point
east of Biloxi, put ashore those who were not yet affected,
instructing them to go west overland where they would be sure
to find the French. However, it must have been west of the
Mississippi instead of east of it. Belle-Isle related, &ldquo;there were
five of us, all died except me. In the distance one day I saw a
camp fire and went to it. The Indians took me captive and made
<span class="pb" id="Page_41">41</span>
me a slave. I was with them eighteen months when Bernardino
bought me from them. Bernardino could understand a few words
of French. He sent the tin box to you. You know the rest. Bernardino,
however, did treat me very well&rdquo;. (Belle-Isle was indeed
lucky; that ship and its entire crew were never heard of again).</p>
<p>I suggest a toast to Dachicoin, who thought like a Frenchman,
spoke like a Spaniard, had all the cunning of an Indian, and the
honesty of a Pilgrim. Such was the importance of Dachicoin.</p>
<p>By the year 1740 Belle-Isle had become a power in politics
at New Orleans.</p>
<p>In 1737 the Natchitoches tribe was able to ship 350 head
of horses to New Orleans as part of its surplus trade-goods, and
all because of Dachicoin, a <i>conachas</i> of the Adais.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="h2line1">IV</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">ST. DENIS AND THE SPANISH</span></h2>
<p>In 1724 St. Denis and Almazon affixed the Arroyo Hondo as
the boundary between the French and the Spanish. There was
also an agreement to allow the French traders, who were to go
to the Upper Caddos during the wet season, to pass through the
Los Adais area. In this same year Jean Muller was permitted
to establish La Post du Bayou Pierre<a class="fn" id="fr_6" href="#fn_6">[6]</a>.</p>
<p>By 1725 St. Denis had won the Spanish commandant over
to his point of view and persuaded him to allow free trade in the
area. The French were also allowed at Los Adais on Sundays to
attend religious services. (The French, up until a few years later,
were without the services of a priest at Natchitoches).</p>
<p>Word reached the Viceroy in Mexico City that Almazon was
too lenient with the French and that he was actually encouraging
open trade with them. In 1730 Almazon was replaced by Don
Juan Antonio de Bustillio y Zavalles, who was quick to realize
that La Presidio de Los Adais was entirely dependent on the
French for its very existence. He sent a letter to the Viceroy to
that effect, further advising that the Spanish settlers of the
area scarcely produced enough crops to sustain themselves and
their families. Zavalles was an experienced military officer and
understood the importance of maintaining a modicum of friendship
<span class="pb" id="Page_43">43</span>
on the frontier with the French and the Indians. Zavalles
in 1730 issued a land grant to Juan de Mora.<a class="fn" id="fr_7" href="#fn_7">[7]</a></p>
<p>In 1730 Natchitoches welcomed the arrival of its first
French priest, Father Vietry.</p>
<p>In April of 1731 Zavalles received an urgent message from
St. Denis saying that the Natchez Indians were on their way to
attack the French Post and asked for assistance. Zavalles sent
fifteen men, which may just have been enough to help St. Denis
gain a victory over the Natchez Indians. One Spaniard lost his
life in the battle.</p>
<p>Zavalles was criticized by his Spanish superiors at San Antonio
and Mexico City for assisting the French, but Zavalles
reasoned that if the French Post had fallen to the Natchez
Indians nothing would have prevented the Natchez from attacking
the Spanish presidio. There was also the possibility of the
Caddos aligning themselves with the Natchez. Such a procedure
had often happened among warring Indian tribes against the
white man. It is far better, if a battle is to be fought, that it
take place in foreign territory. He reasoned that even if the
French lost, there would be other Frenchmen to return and settle
the land. If the Spanish had gained control of the Adais-Natchitoches
frontier their dominance would not have been for long.
As a result of this assistance of the Spanish, food and trade-goods
from the French became more plentiful and cheaper in
price.</p>
<p>Manuel de Sandoval in 1734 replaced Zavalles as Governor
of Los Adais. After a few months on the frontier he left and
assigned Jose Gonzales as Governor of Los Adais. Zavalles in
the meanwhile was being prosecuted at San Antonio de Bexar
because of his leniency with the French. An investigation of the
conditions on the Spanish frontier proved that Zavalles was
correct in his actions. His rank and prestige were restored.
<span class="pb" id="Page_44">44</span>
St. Denis took advantage of the unrest of the Spanish, and
in the midst of protests and letter writing, he moved the Post
St. Jean Baptiste &ldquo;one pistol shot&rdquo; distance to the west bank
of the Red River.</p>
<p>Jose Gonzales was commandante of an ill-equipped presidio,
the crops were failures and the French had control of the food,
but the Spanish always had time for fiesta. And the French came
to visit and trade. Much to the discomfort of Gonzales, fraternization
became the order of the day.</p>
<p>It was the year 1735, when Chamard erected his home and
added a chapel so that civil marriages could be blessed by the
priests from Los Adais on their monthly visits. Natchitoches was
quite often without the services of a priest at this time. Chamard
came to the Natchitoches area in 1730 as an agent and notary
for the Company of the Indies. Chamard was a very devout
Catholic and was a leader in rebuilding the church which had
burned in 1734. He set an excellent example on the frontier
for those who were not inclined to attend religious services
regularly.</p>

<br /><span class="h2line2">DOCTORS AND EARLY MEDICINE&mdash;1722 TO 1744</span></h2>
<p>Medar Jalot had some learning under the direction of Dr.
Ambroise Benoist Gendron of Quebec, Canada. Jalot became a
member of a party under the guidance of Henri De Tonty (The
Iron Hand) that left Quebec in 1710. They came to Biloxi via the
Great Lakes, the Illinois River, the Mississippi River, Lake
Manchac and Lake Pontchartrain. Jalot was with the St. Denis
expedition to Mexico in 1714 as the valet to St. Denis, and in
1722 was listed in the Natchitoches census. Jalot, although not
a doctor by title, served the Natchitoches Post in that capacity
because of his skill in treating wounds and body sores. Jalot also
had knowledge of many Indian remedies for the sicknesses of the
country.</p>
<p>It was the custom at this time for Kings to issue certificates
to men of the medical profession, designating them as <i>Docteur
du Roi</i>, Doctor of the King. Doctors who would accept such a
commission for frontier duty would receive a year&rsquo;s salary in
advance, clothing, a chest of medicine, an allotment of paper,
note books and the personal best wishes of the King. The physician
would then in turn be obliged to render his services free to
the militia and others connected with the service of a post and
the Indians of the surrounding area. The post of his designated-location
would place at the doctor&rsquo;s disposal, an office, lodging
and food at the officers&rsquo; table. Transportation was obligingly
supplied by the King, &ldquo;a one way ticket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To the young Doctor who had thus qualified himself this
would seem to be a golden opportunity. Dr. Le Beau was the first
<span class="pb" id="Page_46">46</span>
to arrive at the Natchitoches post. He was the first Doctor to
realize that this golden opportunity did not supply medium-of-exchange.
The post personnel, their wives and children were
exempt from payment for his services. All of the inhabitants
and their families supplied the post with food and produce, so
they were also exempt as were the Indians. The doctor knew
that he would have to wait two years before he would receive
his next salary from the King. He could receive payment for
his services to the Spanish at Los Adais, but traffic with the
Spanish was forbidden. He was soon to realize that the first
year&rsquo;s pay that had been issued would only buy three pairs of
pants at Rambin&rsquo;s Tailor shop ... and that Rambin was making
his livelihood by redoing old clothing rather than tailoring new
garments. Too, he was duty bound to stay one year in the service
to fulfill his obligation to the Crown. By not doing so he
was subject to arrest. Needless to say, after his year was up Dr.
Le Beau resigned his commission and struck out on his own.</p>
<p>In 1727 Dr. Alexander was the next &ldquo;Docteur du Roi&rdquo; to
arrive in Natchitoches. He was killed in a duel by Captain
Jentzen, a Swedish officer in the service of the King of France.</p>
<p>In 1730 Dr. Godeau arrived with a King&rsquo;s Commission. He
wed the Widow Brossilier, and adopted his two-year-old stepdaughter.
The Widow Brossilier had land, and so this doctor became
a farmer and notary, with his medical profession becoming
a sideline.</p>
<p>The people of the Natchitoches area did not like the idea
of having to pay for doctor&rsquo;s services. Doctor Godeau had,
after his first year resigned his commission, and now could
charge legally for his services. They waited but no new Docteur
du Roi arrived.</p>
<p>Dr. Godeau was at the Natchitoches Post at the time of the
Natchez Indian attack. In this two-months war on the Natchitoches
frontier the Doctor won the friendship of the fifteen
Spaniards who assisted in the defense of the French Post. In
1733 Dr. Godeau travelled to the Adais Post on Saturdays and
Sundays to render his services to the Spanish, and to attend
mass on Sunday. Thus, in the Robeline area was set up the first
<span class="pb" id="Page_47">47</span>
form of medical clinic in all the territory later comprised in the
Louisiana Purchase. The Spanish had money to pay for professional
services which naturally attracted men of any profession.</p>
<p>The people&rsquo;s voice must have been heard, for the Good King
Louis XV sent in 1737 Dr. Tontin. By this time King Louis
must have decided that it was easier to send new doctors each
year as soon as they were qualified <i>medecins</i>. He realized that
the &ldquo;one way ticket&rdquo; was just another way to populate Louisiana
with learned men. Doctor Pain (or Payne) was sent in 1738,
Doctor Jaubaer in 1739, and Doctor Bonnafons in 1740.</p>
<p>So now it was Dr. Bonnafons&rsquo; turn to match his wits with this
French frontier. In sizing up his predicament Dr. Bonnafons
found that the recognized occupations listed on the post roster
as ones that were to obtain free medical service were: Trappers,
Traders, Commercial Hunters and Fishermen, Druggists, Farmers,
Blacksmiths, Store owners, Tailors, Bakers, Carpenters,
Gunsmiths, Butchers, Soldiers and the Indians. The good commandante,
Louis Juchereau de St. Denis, saw to it that all of
these men obtained their just share of the Post business. I feel
sure, too, that the doctors, Pain, Jambare and Tontin advised
Doctor Bonnafons what to expect. This doctor, however, had the
wits to fit the occasion. He demanded of St. Denis that because
the office space inside the fort was too small, that a building be
erected outside the fort for his home and office. He showed the
commandante that according to the rights enumerated in his
commission that the Post Commander must furnish him with
these suitable conveniences. St. Denis complied with the doctor&rsquo;s
demands.</p>
<p>Dr. Bonnafons became a barber and for this privilege he
paid a license. Being a barber he was allowed to sell drugs. The
druggist was part of the Grocery Guild, so that he was now
qualified to sell &ldquo;stuffs&rdquo; (bolts of uncut cloth). Sieur Ignace
Antee, a farmer and part-time cobbler, was encouraged to erect
a lean-to on the opposite side of the doctor&rsquo;s building. Because he
had assisted Laignon and Antee to erect their lean-tos, Dr. Bonnafons
considered himself a carpenter. He informed Jacques
<span class="pb" id="Page_48">48</span>
Turpeax, a soldier and baker at the Natchitoches Post, that he
would purchase the surplus bread which was baked and not
used by the militia, thus furnishing quick lunches for weary,
hungry travelers. Because the Doctor was in the grocery business,
he could sell wine which went well with the cheese brought
to the French Post by the inhabitants of Campti.</p>
<p>One must realize that we are at a time between the dates
1740 and 1744, because St. Denis died in 1744, and that the
location of Dr. Bonnafons&rsquo; building would have been near the
new fort which had been erected by St. Denis &ldquo;one pistol shot to
the west&rdquo; from the location of the Fort St. Jean Baptiste as shown
on Breutin&rsquo;s Map of 1722. This placed the new fort in the
environs of what was later the American cemetery. As to the
location of Dr. Bonnafons&rsquo; building we have this clue. In his
ledger he states that he obtained land adjoining his from Duplessis.
On Breutin&rsquo;s map the Duplessis land would have been in the
vicinity of the south bank of Bayou Amulet near G. W. Black&rsquo;s
Grocery and Market. Also, in this same area along Bayou Amulet
the traders coming to Natchitoches tethered their mules.</p>
<p>Having obtained this land adjoining his building, Dr. Bonnafons
erected a blacksmith shop for Jean Baptist Marin. As
the doctor&rsquo;s business grew, so did the buildings and the good
doctor had his eye out for more business and reasoned that
&ldquo;where their is a demand, there should be a supply&rdquo;.</p>
<p>About 20 years preceding Dr. Bonnafons&rsquo; arrival in Natchitoches,
some of the farmers had obtained slaves from New
Orleans. The slaves, coming directly from Africa, believed in
voodoo, and for a generation had sold their charms, amulets, love
potions and cure-all charms to the Indians, as well as the white
inhabitants.</p>
<p>Dr. Bonnafons, being a druggist and grocer was allowed,
according to the Drug Guild, to sell notions. So he added a trinket
department to his store which had such items as earrings, necklaces,
mirrors and of course the voodoo charms. Bonnafons
reasoned that the local natives and inhabitants might just as
well have the imported kind from New Orleans where the voodoo
charm-makers were more skilled and the charms had more
<span class="pb" id="Page_49">49</span>
power. He reasoned with himself that according to law, slaves
were not allowed to have money or engage in a business which
would supply them with money. So he decided to put them out
of business. Naturally Dr. Bonnafons told his customers that he
did not believe in voodoo, that he was a doctor and that only
a doctor could cure illnesses&mdash;that the charms were just novelties
and that some people bought them in ignorance.</p>
<p>Commercial traders with the Indians who bought such
trinkets from Dr. Bonnafons at a discount were Jean Camion,
Nicholas and Jean Lassard, Pierre Gaigne, Lantallac, Nicholas
Tibaud, Francois Gueno, De Lima of Los Adais, Francois Moreau,
Jean Robalet, Louis Barme, Joseph Le Douc, Jean Baptiste Derbonne,
Le Bomme, Henri Vidol and Pierre Bossier. By supplying
these traders Dr. Bonnafons became the first wholesaler of merchandise
in the Natchitoches section.</p>
<p>As the following bill testifies, Dr. Louis Bonnafons served
the Natchitoches area well. The bill concerns the services rendered
to Pierre Fausse&rsquo;s young son.</p>
<dl class="undent"><dt>1. Pour <i>6</i> bouttiles de quillendive<a class="fn" id="fr_8" href="#fn_8">[8]</a> per l&rsquo;order du chirurgiens.</dt>
<dt>2. Pour <i>6</i> denier (6 articles of merchandise.)</dt>
<dt>3. Pour 12 boutilles d&rsquo;eau de vie. (Brandy used as a sedative to settle nerves and upset stomach.)</dt>
<dt>4. Pour <i>6</i> bouttiles de medecine laxatif (laxatives).</dt>
<dt>5. Pour le cerceuil de defuma. (For making the coffin.)</dt></dl>
<p>The child was given 6 bottles of nausea medicine, 12 bottles
of brandy (that is, if the child was given all of the brandy&mdash;he
may have had help in disposing of this medicine) and 6 bottles
of laxatives. This was enough of such medicine to kill any patient.
Dr. Bonnafons, being the doctor in attendance, would also be
the first to know of the child&rsquo;s death. Thus being a carpenter
he was also a cabinet maker which made him a coffin-maker.
Thus Dr. Bonnafons was also an undertaker.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>From Dr. Louis Bonnafons&rsquo; ledger, covering a six-year period
from 1741 to 1747, come these names and families: Joseph Lattier,
soldier; Claud Bertrand, soldier; Jean La Berry, soldier;
Louis Juchereau de St. Denis family; Antoine Chesneau family;
Michel Chesneau family; Pierre Baillio, soldier; Vencient Perrier
family; Remi Possiot family; Louis Rachal family; Gaspard
Barbier, brother of Madam Cheveret&mdash;&ldquo;bought violin sold to
me by Bartholmey Rachal&rdquo;; Joseph Robideux (Robeaux), one
powder horn; Jean Baptiste Gonnin, carpenter; Francois Gurno,
carpenter; Pierre Allarg, carpenter; Pierre Mercer, farmer;
Andre Barringer, farmer; Remi Possiot, soldier; Fancois Langlois,
soldier; Edwardo Lattier, soldier-farmer; Louis Badin,
farmer; Andries Rambin family; Louis Rambin family; Madam
de La Chaise. There were many more, but to list them would be
a repetition of names mentioned earlier in this book.</p>
<p>Dr. Louis Bonnafons died in 1759. He never married. His
ledger brings out but one important fact: Natchitoches and El
Camino Real area has always had possibilities for the right sort
of man. Likewise, these so-called, one-stop, shopping centers are
nothing new to our country. Too, during this early period of the
Natchitoches community there was a form of socialized medicine,
which proved even at this early period a doctor could not exist
by merely depending on his chosen profession for a livelihood
when controlled or limited by the state.</p>

<br /><span class="h2line2">ROMANCE AT LOS ADAIS</span></h2>
<p>There was quite a stir on the fine spring morning of April 8,
1735 at Los Adais. Senorita Victoria Gonzales, daughter of the
Lieutenant Governor of this Spanish presidio, had eloped with
a Frenchman, Jean Baptista DerBonne, assisted by two other
Frenchmen of the Post St. Jean Baptiste des Natchitoches after
the High Mass that Sunday. Governor Gonzales, holding office
during the absence of Governor Manuel de Sandoval, and Reverend
Padre Ignacio Certa were talking when word of the elopement
was brought. A searching party was immediately organized
but was unsuccessful in capturing the culprits.</p>
<p>The next day Gonzales wrote a letter to his superiors, stating
the above details and adding that, even though DerBonne was
a French officer and a gentleman, he had refused permission
for the marriage. He was so infuriated that he disowned his
daughter, thereby wishing to show to the officials over him that
he had nothing to do with this matter. However, he did suspect
Padre Certa and his brother-in-law Juan de Mora, because both
had intervened in DerBonne&rsquo;s behalf. He also added that de
Mora was in jail and at present he had not decided what to do
with him. He received word that the party arrived in Natchitoches
at midnight, and Father Pierre Vietry, a priest of the
Jesuit Order, had married Victoria and DerBonne immediately,
thus violating the laws of the Catholic Faith. He wrote: &ldquo;As
you know the banns of betrothed have to be announced at three
Sunday Services before the wedding. I am told that the elopers
traveled by pirogue, going from arroyo to arroyo and finally
<span class="pb" id="Page_52">52</span>
reaching the Red River and then on to Natchitoches, which explains
why our land searching-party did not find them. Padre
Vallejo of the Mission Margil de Los Adais is going to Natchitoches
to request wine so necessary in the procedure of the
Mass. I am sure Victoria will accompany him back to Los Adais
to get her things and the family blessing. Now that she has
been married by the Church there is nothing I can do. She is
seventeen and of marriageable age.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two nationalities had much to say to each other about
this wonderful new topic of conversation. The Spanish would
give credit to Victoria for planning the whole thing, after all a
woman of Victoria&rsquo;s intelligence must have planned it because
certainly a Frenchman could not have had the head for such
clever thinking&mdash;DerBonne was just the lucky one who won her
heart. The French would say that DerBonne was a sly one, that
he had stolen Victoria from under their very eyes. The stupid
Spanish bachelors, allowing such a pretty prize as Victoria to
slip away from them. And so the talk went, but there has to be
a formula for each and every elopement that is successful.</p>
<p>Now in this case, take three bayous, a little river and a larger
river, mix with one uncle, a willing duenna, two willing assistants,
two understanding priests, a friend. Add a handsome
French officer, a beautiful senorita and an irate father. Then
allow a certain amount of time for observation to turn into
fascination, watch closely as fascination develops into desire and
desire materializes into love, then you will have the correct ingredients
for a successful elopement. So explains the material
gathered from John Eskew, Belisle, J. Fair Hardin, Ross Phares
and Poitre-Babinsik. All of these authors have shed some light
on this incident.</p>
<p>Now, as a certain character would say, let&rsquo;s add up the facts.</p>
<p>Jean Baptist Der Bonne or Derbonne as the French would
write it, was an officer at the French Post, Jean Baptist Des
Natchitoches. The Spanish Post, Del Presidio Nuestra Senora
del Pilar de Los Adais, was roughly 17 miles due west. The
dividing boundary was the Arroyo Hondo, a small stream that
ran roughly north and south midway between these two outposts.
<span class="pb" id="Page_53">53</span>
True, both nationalities respected this boundary to a certain
extent, that is they visited openly but hid their trading with each
other.</p>
<p>The Spanish had use of the good Doctor Payne (Pain), the
post Doctor at Natchitoches, in return the Spanish Fiesta was
open to all. If a Frenchman visited the Spanish Church for
Mass or Confession he was very welcome.</p>
<p>Father Ignacio Certa admitted in one of his letters that he
had spoken to Gonzales in behalf of Der Bonne. Certainly this
priest must have approved of the Frenchman or he would not
have intervened for him.</p>
<p>The foster brother of Gonzales&rsquo;s wife, Juan de Mora, was
a very good friend of Der Bonne because he helped and was
put into prison because of the incident. Even this imprisonment
was a sham, as de Mora could have gone to the post at Natchitoches
a guest of DerBonne. He could have left immediately
after the two eloped and with a fast horse, reached Natchitoches
well ahead of any searchers. I believe de Mora remained at Los
Adais and allowed himself to be imprisoned so that his brother-in-law,
Gonzales, might save face with his superiors in Mexico
and the Tejas country. There are no records revealing a trial
or punishment of Juan de Mora. One thing is certain, there
was a food and clothing shortage at Los Adais and de Mora was
one of the Spaniards who was on very good terms with the
French officer, DerBonne. And DerBonne, being an officer,
would have enough influence at the French post at Natchitoches
to assist the Spanish traders in getting more reasonable bargains
when purchasing food and clothing there. Too, DerBonne being
a French officer, as a side line, also was a trader among the
Indians and certainly with the Spanish. Now that the Frenchman
had taken a Spanish wife and she being the daughter of
Gonzalez, the Gonzalez family would certainly profit by this
marriage. The deals, however, having been transacted through
DerBonne and de Mora and both men now being of the Gonzalez
family would leave the Lieutenant Governor in the clear as far
as his superiors were concerned.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>The duenna (chaperone) of Victoria Gonzalez must have
assisted the two lovers, reasoning that the duties of a duenna,
are to look after her charge&rsquo;s morals and religious training and
to teach her things she must know concerning her social standing
and her responsibilities to her family in respect to marriage.
A duenna, therefore accepted or rejected those who wished to
court her charge. Quite often the duenna had to be won as well
as the young senorita. The chaperone&rsquo;s duty was to channel her
young charge&rsquo;s affections and thoughts toward the suitor considered
most able to support the young lady in the manner to
which she was accustomed; but the duenna would also observe
the suitors that the senorita liked best, and by elimination, to
these she thought most suitable, certain privileges would be allowed.
In this case the suitor was DerBonne. Now came the
time for observation to turn into fascination. To watch closely
as fascination develops into desire, and then when desire materializes
into love, arrangements must be made so that the
wedding can be solemnized. The duenna or chaperone was also a
match-maker.</p>
<p>Now for allowing those certain privileges. At a fiesta at
Los Adais, DerBonne and Victoria danced, and after a while
walked out into the patio for a breath of fresh air. The man,
being a gentleman, would not on first meeting attempt to guide
his companion to a darkened shadowy spot for closer conversation.
The duenna naturally followed and observed at a discreet
distance. She would locate herself at such vantage point where
she could see and yet not be seen.</p>
<p>At Church on Sunday, DerBonne having received an invitation
from de Mora, with de Mora advising DerBonne to be there
early, arrangements were made so that DerBonne sat next to
Victoria, with the duenna on one side of the couple and de Mora
on the other. Perhaps at sometime during the services of the
Mass the duenna suggested a walk in a certain direction, making
sure that DerBonne overheard the suggestion intended for Victoria.
Just to be sure, immediately after the Church Services
de Mora would suggest a stroll before eating the noon meal,
and, as if by chance both parties met at some point on a secluded
<span class="pb" id="Page_55">55</span>
footpath, the young couple would find that for the moment they
were alone and unobserved, while the elderly couple was engaged
in some topic of conversation. Now for a quick embrace and
kiss while the old duenna was not looking. To these well planned,
or chance meetings as the young couple thought, surely fate was
lending a helping hand. So fascination turns into desire and
desire into love. Now to ask for her hand in marriage (the old
duenna and de Mora must have felt proud of themselves.) DerBonne
asked the father, Jose Gonzalez, but the irate father refused.
Then the priest, Father Ignacio Certa, interceded on
behalf of DerBonne. Another refusal as the obdurate father
explained that the Spanish authorities would not permit such a
thing on the frontier. After all, the Spanish and the French were
rivals here, and such a marriage might even lead to war among
the two nationalities at these outposts of empire.</p>
<p>DerBonne was well aware of the dire consequences that might
result from the marriage and without a doubt had discussed the
situation with his Commandante, St. Denis. Now, Louis Juchereau
de St. Denis was one of the slyest and most commercial-minded
men who ever trod the soil of Natchitoches, certainly
the most adventurous. Without accusing him of entering into
a conspiracy, he evaluated the circumstances concerning this
elopement, and weighed the risks of the outcome.</p>
<p>First, DerBonne was a good French soldier and officer and
if he were to get married this would bring about family ties on
the frontier, which would keep him in the Natchitoches district
(quite often when a soldier&rsquo;s enlistment expired he left the
Natchitoches area for greener pastures). DerBonne would settle
land nearby so that his wife to be would be near her own people.
Eventually when his enlistment expired, the French would have
an experienced officer in this area without having to pay for
his services. DerBonne was also a trader, and his supplies were
furnished by the store at the Natchitoches post and St. Denis
received a commission on all merchandise sold at the post as well
as on all trade merchandise sent back to New Orleans. This
marriage between DerBonne and the daughter of a high ranking
<span class="pb" id="Page_56">56</span>
official at Los Adais would naturally bring on better trade relations,
even if it was to be effected in a slightly underhand way.</p>
<p>Secondly, St. Denis understood the love of a Spanish parent
wishing to see his offspring happily married. He probably
thought of his own marriage to Manuella and how her family
risked all their worldly possessions and position of office to
protect his marriage into the Don Diego Ramone family. The
Spanish, to be sure, had their faults, but also they must be commended
for their forgiving and understanding nature when the
welfare of their families was concerned. In this respect Jose
Gonzalez, the Lieutenant Governor of Los Adais, would be no
exception. He knew that this man would have to do a great deal
of letter writing and pretending but in the end would be a
forgiving father-in-law. St. Denis, after weighing the risks,
secretly consented to lend his support to this marriage. Even if
the risks had been greater St. Denis would have given his consent
because his whole life, if one studies it carefully, was full
of risks and intrigue. One more incident would have made no
difference to him. The fact is that he probably enjoyed the
entire situation, for this affair would bring a new topic of interest
and conversation to the dull life of the frontier.</p>
<p>The whole procedure of the successful elopement suggests the
cool, calculating mind of one such as St. Denis possessed, not
the flustrated mind of a young lover.</p>
<p>Let us examine the water-route that these two elopers
traveled: The Arroyo Adais, a small stream of water that ran
near the Presidio De Los Adais and then into the Bayou Mayoux.
This bayou ran into La Petite Rigolet (Little River, as it is
known today) in turn ran into Bayou Pierre, which drained into
Red River (just above Grande Ecore) flowed past the French
fort at Natchitoches. The distance traveled would be about
twenty-four miles.</p>
<p>Governor Gonzalez&rsquo;s letter states that DerBonne and two
Frenchmen ran off with his daughter. These two Frenchmen
would have to be hand-picked men capable of carrying out an
assignment without a flaw. Men who could stand the rigors of
twenty-four miles of continuous paddling, part of the time being
<span class="pb" id="Page_57">57</span>
in the black of the night, men who could be trusted to keep their
mouths shut, and above all men who were not afraid of danger
for which there would be no profit to them and certain imprisonment
if they were caught. Evidently the post at Natchitoches
had two such men. However, their names are not mentioned.
So by process of elimination of the known inhabitants of Natchitoches
at this time let&rsquo;s see if we can determine who these two
men were. But first, one most important point that should be
brought out, because as they were to travel by water there could
be no risk of a drowning, especially of the girl&mdash;if this were
to happen war would certainly follow. The inhabitants of
Natchitoches in 1736 were: St. Denis, Commandante, his wife,
Manuella and his children; Pierre Largen, trader, married to
an Ais Indian maiden; Lt. Basset next in command; Lobotiniere,
trader and farmer, married; Duterpints, soldier and baker
for the post; Jean Lagross, trader and merchant, settled across
the river from Campti; Dr. Payne (Pain), Doctor and Notary,
married; Jean Baptista Deherbonne (BerBonne, Derbon, Derbonne);
Lt. Gautren, married; Lafreniere, soldier; Joseph La
Duc, soldier; Prudhomme, planter and trader, married; Sieur
Barme, store keeper, married; Jacques De La Chase, government
storekeeper, married; P. Duplessis, Notary, married; Father
Pierre Vietry, Jesuit Priest; Sieur Bacque, farmer, married;
Pierre Mercer, farmer; Andre Berrange, farmer; Antoine Germaine,
soldier; Juan Biseros, merchant, married; Antonio Charbonnet,
merchant; Gilbert Maxent, merchant; Pierre Gaignie,
trader, married; Nicholas Tibaud, trader; Paul Muller, soldier;
the two Barberousses, hunters contracted to supply meat for the
Post; LaRenaudiere, a miller; Rambin, a tailor, married; the
Dupress brothers, hunters and trappers; DeLame, storekeeper
and trader; Jean Layssard and Nicholas Layssard, brothers,
soldiers and traders; Lantallic, farmer and trader; Sieur Badin,
farmer, trader and storekeeper; Francois Lemoine, soldier in
love with Victoria Emanuella Garcia; Sieur Jambare, doctor.</p>
<p>According to a 1735 census there were only 32 people at
Natchitoches, however, this must have meant the personnel of
the Post St. Jean Baptist. It will be noticed that there were
<span class="pb" id="Page_58">58</span>
many traders listed, undoubtedly many of these were also
soldiers, but not listed as soldiers, because a soldier&rsquo;s pay was
so small, and that they were paid only once a year, if at all.
Many of them drew from the Army Post Exchange and sold
this merchandise either to the Indians or the Spaniards, who
seemed to have many gold coins, but there the army post had
nothing to sell them. The reason being that Los Adais was too
remote from its base of supplies.</p>
<p>Of all the names listed, the two most likely to have assisted
DerBonne would have been Francois Lemoine and Jean Lagrosse.
I give these reasons&mdash;Francois Lemoine was young, strong and
ablebodied or he would not have been a soldier. He was in love
with a Spaniard, Victoria Emanuello Garcia. Therefore, if someone
was willing to break the barrier between the two nations
he might profit by assisting and observing the outcome. Jean
Lagross, Indian trader had married a Caddo maiden of the Ais
tribe. By so doing he was recognized as a member and friend
of the Caddo federation of which the Adais Indians at Los
Adais was also a tribe of this federation. This being the case
the Adais would not take part in a search for a member of their
own nation if their assistance was requested by the Governor
of the Spanish Fort. Lagross had been with St. Denis during
his stay in Mexico, he had a good knowledge of the Spaniard&rsquo;s
abilities, and too, Lagross had many friends among the Spanish.
Being a trader he had traveled this water route many times. His
skilled hands would surely be the ones to steer the pirogue safely
back to Natchitoches.</p>
<p>The good friends, St. Denis and Manuella, would have met
the boat when it arrived at Natchitoches. Manuella would not
have missed this wedding for anything. After all Victoria was
of her own people and who in Natchitoches could best represent
her.</p>
<p>Now for the part of Gonzalez&rsquo;s letter stating that a priest
could not marry a couple without the proper notices of the
betrothal being read on three consecutive Sundays. This is true
in most cases, but, there is an old saying that the French always
had a way for everything, and so in this case they had a way
<span class="pb" id="Page_59">59</span>
which was recognized by the Church. Due to the shortage of
priests in Louisiana there was a ceremony of marriage called
&ldquo;jumping the broom&rdquo; and in the eyes of witnesses this was
considered a just and true marriage. The couple vowed that
the wedding would be solemnized as soon as a priest was available
(Quite often in recent years this procedure was looked upon
as a joke but in the year 1735 in Louisiana it was no joking
matter). Here, too, a time element was necessary. Possibly
somewhere en-route to Natchitoches this party pulled the boat
onto the bank long enough to make a broom of switch cane and
the two witnesses, Lagrosse and Lemoine, watched as DerBonne
and Victoria jumped the broom. This was necessary. You will
note that the wedding took place after mid-night or right at
mid-night, the beginning of another day. When the couple told
Father Vietry that they had jumped the broom yesterday they
did not lie, they had witnesses to prove it. Father Pierre Vietry
had no choice but to marry them.</p>
<p>Just so you do not get the wrong impression of Jose Gonzalez
you should know that in his letter he states that Padre Vallejo
was going to Natchitoches the next day and that Victoria would
return with him to receive blessings of her family. Later maps
of Natchitoches show that DerBonne owned more land than
St. Denis, the Commandante of the Natchitoches Post. Gonzalez
could have refused Victoria her dowry because she eloped. Either
she got the dowry or DerBonne was an excellent trader. With
twenty eight known competitors in the same profession, I believe
he got the dowry, and Papa Gonzalez saved face and his position
by the elopement happening as it did. And, too, I believe Jose
could have written that letter before the elopement and put down
the facts just as they occurred.</p>
<p>In July of the same year Francois Lemoine married Victoria
Manuella Garcia. And so ... the Arroyo Honda barrier came
down.</p>

<br /><span class="h2line2">INCIDENTS OF THE YEARS, 1735-1742</span></h2>
<p>In 1735 Justine de Louche was the first to settle in the area of
Cloutierville, Louisiana.</p>
<p>In 1736 Manuel Flores and Carlos Bustimento demanded the
same privileges allowed Sanchez, that the Spanish Governor of
Los Adais give them title to their land. This was granted and
soon to follow were grants to Solice, Toro, Rodriguez, Martinez
and Garcia. These family men soon became independent and
also became traders among the Indians.</p>
<p>In this same year Benites Franquis de Lugo replaced Sandoval
as Governor of Los Adais. An old enemy of Sandoval, he placed
him under arrest and stripped the ex-governor of his wealth and
rank. He was charged with deserting the post at Los Adais and
going to live at San Antonio de Bexar, thereby neglecting the
duties of his office; and for recognizing the Arroyo Hondo
boundary instead of the west bank of the Red River, thus allowing
the French to build a new fort on that side of the Red River.</p>
<p>The friends of Sandoval appealed to the Viceroy to send
witnesses to Los Adais to investigate the charges of Governor
Lugo.</p>
<p>In 1737 Fernandez de Jauregui y Urritgua, who was at that
time Governor of Nueva Leon, a region which adjoined the
Coahuila and Tejas country, came to Los Adais as a <i>visatador</i>
(witness). He questioned the population, visited the post at
Natchitoches and made inquiries there. Lieutenant Gonzalez explained
the conditions of the presidio, the shortage of manpower
<span class="pb" id="Page_61">61</span>
and food and how nearly all the necessities necessary to sustain
life had to be obtained from the French.</p>
<p>Urritgua left Prudincio de Orbito as temporary governor,
arrested Lugo, sent a message back to the Viceroy clearing
Sandavol of all charges and requesting that the prisoner be
restored to his position. In the same year San Antonious Bazaterra
was sent as Governor of Los Adais and all of the Texas
Region. Bazaterra was a merchant from Saltillo in Mexico, and
he used his new position to transport his personal merchandise
to the Adais frontier. He demanded that the Spanish cease
trading with the French.</p>
<p>In April, 1738, he detained and arrested Jean Lagross, a
French trader en-route to the Upper Caddos on the big bend of
the Red River. According to the Arroyo Hondo agreement between
Sandavol and St. Denis, the French traders were to be
allowed to pass through the Spanish held Adais land during the
wet season. Jean Lagross had a passport to that effect, but
Bazaterra refused to recognize the passport and had Lagross&rsquo;
merchandise burned in front of witnesses.</p>
<p>Word of his action soon reached St. Denis and messages were
sent to Los Adais, to San Antonio and to Mexico City, by means
of Indian carriers. Bazaterra was accused of trouble making
and charged with making advances toward Lagross&rsquo; wife, who,
although an Indian, had been legally wed to Lagross at La Mission
Senora de Guadelupe at Nacogdoches. Therefore she was
a French woman and had been recognized as such by the French
at Natchitoches and by the Spanish at Los Adais since her
wedding. St. Denis also reminded the Spanish officials that due
to the fact that Lagross had taken an Ais maiden for his wife,
in the eyes of the Caddo Federation of Indians, Lagross was a
Caddo according to the Indian&rsquo;s viewpoint, therefore, this injustice
could lead to serious trouble if the Frenchman were not
compensated for his loss. Much to the disappointment of Bazaterra,
he was ordered to pay Lagross for his merchandise out
of his own pocket. &ldquo;Such&rdquo;, remarked St. Denis, &ldquo;is the power of
the pen&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Bazaterra, however, in spite of his difficulties, piled up the
<span class="pb" id="Page_62">62</span>
equivalent of forty thousand dollars during his nearly four-year
tenure as Governor on the Adais frontier. It must be said on
his behalf that he was an excellent tradesman. St. Denis admitted
that he was glad to see him leave.</p>
<p>In 1741 Thomas Phillip Winthuisin replaced Bazaterra as
Governor of Los Adais. The new governor was a civilian and
lacking in the knowledge of the military. This in itself presented
a dangerous situation on the Adais frontier. The inhabitants
requested that a man of the military be sent to Los Adais.</p>
<p>And in 1742 the talk of the year was how two ex-French
soldiers, Lavespere and Brossilier, maintained <i>travasser</i> (a kind
of flat boat) service from New Orleans to Natchitoches, bringing
additional medical supplies to Dr. Bonnafons. These two
men had rigged their boat with pulleys which enabled them to
pull the boat through the shallow places in the river at low-water
stage.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="h2line1">VIII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE THREE CABINS</span></h2>
<p>Jose Guiterez, a <i>mestizo</i> (a person of mixed Indian and Spanish
blood) was returning from Natchitoches after having visited
the store of Dr. Bonnafons. As he descended the trail down the
side of Grand Montania he allowed his horse to pick its way. At
the foot of this high hill a small creek flowed called the Arroyo
Hondo and at the bank of the small creek he must rest his
animal for a while before continuing on to his home near the
Presidio de Los Adais. The spring of the year 1742 had been a
very trying and wet year, the Arroyo Hondo would be wider
now because of so much rainfall. He always felt good when he
reached this small rivulet, considered the half-way distance from
Los Adais to Natchitoches, for in his mind he felt he was more
than half-way home.</p>
<p>As Guiterez rested he thought of his horse, a beautiful stallion.
He often wondered if the Indian who had traded the mare,
which was with foal at the time and later delivered this colt,
envied him now because of the trade. Certainly many of the
French officers at Natchitoches and Los Adais had tried to buy
the animal, but Jose would always refuse to consider even talking
of a trade or sale. Not only because he was such a fine
animal, he loved the horse, <i>El Trumpitero</i>, named so because of
the shrill whinnies the horse voiced when a female of his species
was in his vicinity. And Jose had reaped generous profits in
stud fees. The horse had made quite a name for himself and for
his owner, Jose Guiterez.</p>
<p>The year before the young Spaniard had been sent to the
Presidio de San Antonio de Bexar to deliver a message from
<span class="pb" id="Page_64">64</span>
the Governor, Winthusin, to the alvarez of San Antonio de
Bexar asking his opinion about paying the French trader, Jean
Lagross, for goods that had been confiscated by the former
Governor of Los Adais, Bazaterra, after he had granted a passport
to the Frenchman to travel through the Spanish territory
when going to trade with the Caddos on upper Red River.</p>
<p>The alvarez at San Antonio de Bexar did not see the situation
as clearly as did the Governor of Los Adais and was inclined
to advise against paying Lagross. He first asked Guiterez&rsquo;s
opinion concerning the contents of the message because he was
the only one present who would know some of the events that
led to the new Governor of Los Adais&rsquo; request. Guiterez explained
to the alvarez that this particular situation was important
because the French trader had married an Ais Indian
maiden, therefore, in the eyes of all of the Caddo tribes he was
considered a Caddo and the whole Caddo Federacy might take
offense if the goods were not paid for; that on the Adais frontier
it was necessary to maintain friendly relations with the French
in order to purchase much-needed food supplies for the Spanish
troops at el Presidio de Los Adais. Jean Lagross was one of
the Frenchmen with the Ramone Domingo expedition that established
the Spanish missions as far as the Nacogdoches Indians,
and from that year, 1716, he had traded among the Indians of
this frontier. For the last twenty-five years he had been known
favorably in all this country.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is no ordinary French trader but one who is loved by
the Spanish, French and the Indians, it is best to pay him for
his merchandise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>El Trumpitero had carried his master to San Antonio de
Bexar and back to Los Adais in less than three weeks, a distance
of over a thousand miles. Another time the horse went to
Natchitoches and back to Los Adais for medicine for a sick
soldier, over thirty miles, in five hours. Because of his horse
Guiterez had become the official messenger of Los Adais, which
had by now realized the importance of his horse. The children
at Los Adais greeted the horse and waved at him as if the animal
<span class="pb" id="Page_65">65</span>
was a human being. Jose and his horse were such a common
sight at Natchitoches even inside the post.</p>
<p>On each occasion when he arrived at Natchitoches he always
felt obliged to go by the house of St. Denis, whose wife was
Spanish, and tell her of the news at Los Adais. He was likewise
welcomed at the house of Jean Baptist DerBonne who had wed
Victoria Gonzalez, the daughter of a past governor of Los Adais.
Another hospitable friend, Francois Lemoine, was a cousin of
Louis Juchereau de St. Denis of the Lemoyne family as were
Iberville and Bienville. This young French soldier had married
Victoria Emmanuella Garcia, the daughter of a Spanish sergeant
of the Presidio at Los Adais. Thus Jose Guiterez was most welcome
at these three homes of Frenchmen in Natchitoches. Aside
from bringing news to these three Spanish ladies, they in turn
found out through Guiterez what the needs of the women of
Los Adais were and then purchased these necessities for them
from the stores at Natchitoches because trade between the two
posts was forbidden. As a result the Spanish women at Los
Adais did their trading through the Spanish women at Natchitoches,
which custom continued even when trade between the
two posts was not forbidden.</p>
<p>As Jose sat on the bank of the Arroyo Hondo admiring his
horse, he leaned against the trunk of a tall, slender tree and
began to think about his future. For a long time he had felt that
there was something lacking in his life but he had not been able
to put his finger on the cause of his unrest. He questioned himself
about his status in life, concerning his accomplishments and
his ability to support himself and his parents, and came to the
conclusion he needed a wife and property of his own&mdash;either a
farm or a business of some kind. He knew that his parents did
not need support from him and that his older brothers actually
operated the small rancho and farm&mdash;they were all married
and therefore would continue to remain on the family estate.
According to the custom of the times, the oldest brother would
inherit the estate, that is the profits from the operation of it.
He, Jose Guiterez, decided he would strike out for himself, perhaps
engaging in some kind of business for he did not like rancho
<span class="pb" id="Page_66">66</span>
or farm work. Being a soldier had too many disadvantages. True,
in the end after an enlistment period, a soldier was given a certain
amount of land, farm animals and equipment. He could get
them from his own family if he needed them. Being a settler
on a frontier was just as important as being a soldier, each in
his own way was serving the purpose of making the frontier
secure.</p>
<p>There was a chatter of birds in the tree tops just above his
head which broke his train of thought and brought him back to
reality. As he looked upward Jose marvelled at the size and the
straightness of the trees from which the chatter of the birds
had come. Then he noticed how nearly all the trees were of uniform
size, straight, and all nearly sixty feet high. Here was
definitely cabin material and even in this small grove there were
enough such trees to make several cabins. Odd, he thought, he
had passed this place many times and did not notice the surroundings
as he did this day. As his thoughts raced ahead he
remembered that he had stopped to rest, almost always everyone
else who passed this way also stopped. Here would be the place
to establish some sort of tavern, wine shop or eating place. Why,
he wondered, had not someone thought of this before, to erect
such a place here on the Arroyo Hondo where people must pass
and where they always stop to rest a while. Jose reasoned that
the wine shop, tavern and inn, must be available for the French,
Spanish and Indian trade, and regardless of what would be
traded to him, whether furs or trade goods, sooner or later he
could turn them into gold and silver. Now, for obtaining the
land. The east side of the Arroyo Hondo, where he intended to
establish this new business, belonged to the French. According
to an agreement between St. Denis and Governor Almazon in
1724, the dividing line between the French and Spanish would
be the Arroyo Hondo instead of the west bank of the Red
River as previously claimed by the Spanish. To acquire this deed
would require some tact. First, he would get the land and then
a wife who could be able to help him operate his business.
Which nationality owned this land on the east bank of the Arroyo
Hondo made no difference. Jose decided that he would get a
<span class="pb" id="Page_67">67</span>
grant-title from both representatives of their respective governments.
It would be interesting to see if he, a Spaniard, might
obtain a land grant from the French, too, and if this could be
done, it would be quite a feather in his hat, making him more
popular among his Spanish friends.</p>
<p>The grove of trees and the slight rise of the earth there
formed a sort of flat shelf. The land was about ninety <i>toises</i>
(540 feet) square and extended from the Arroyo Hondo to the
base of Grand Montania, and the trail leading up the face of
Grand Montania divided the land. This was a good feature and
he would ask for all land on each side of the trail so that no one
else could come in and establish another business near this resting
place and be his competitor.</p>
<p>Guiterez was excited. Even he, with no experience in the
operation of such a tavern, could see the immediate success
of it.</p>
<p>El Trumpitero with a loud whinney announced the presence
of other horses in the vicinity, and, as Jose looked across the
Arroyo Hondo, he could see a small pack train composed of
eight horses and three riders. As the train neared and the
animals began to ford the stream he recognized the party of Jean
Lagross with his Ais squaw wife, Isobel, and their daughter,
Francine Manuella, named &ldquo;Manuella&rdquo; to honor Madam St.
Denis, who was her godmother.</p>
<p>Because of so much rainfall the water of the stream was
swift and deep, and Jose rode El Trumpitero out to the ford to
offer assistance to the party if needed.</p>
<p>One thing that both the French and Spanish had learned
from the Indians was the maintenance of markers on fordable
streams such as the Arroyo Hondo. Slender, cypress poles were
placed in a line and at intervals across the stream, each pole was
painted in rings of green, yellow and red; the red being at the
top of the pole. By looking at the poles and their markings the
depth of the water could be ascertained. The markers were on
each side of the crossing marking the now submerged trail. This
ford crossing of the Arroyo Hondo was only about sixty feet
from bank to bank, but on occasion it could be very dangerous
<span class="pb" id="Page_68">68</span>
if one were not careful and allowed the current to get the upper
hand. The water at this time had risen past the red markings on
the poles, denoting the stream to be nearly six feet deep and
warning that fording it would be dangerous. Jose had noticed the
markings and this was the reason that he rode his horse part
way out into the water.</p>
<p>Jose shouted across to Lagross to have the women mount
the largest horses, and in the meantime he cast his long rawhide
rope to Lagross. The rope was put around the lead-horse&rsquo;s
neck and other rawhide ropes were placed around the other
horses&rsquo; necks and attached to the packs. In this manner the single
file of horses and their burdens crossed the Arroyo Hondo without
mishap.</p>
<p>As is common in the Los Adais-Natchitoches area in the
month of March, rains can come suddenly and frequently and this
day was no exception. While the party was crossing the stream,
a cold, peppering shower began which turned into a steady downpour.
Immediately the two women began unpacking one of the
horses. This pack contained several hides sewn together, the
four corners were attached to four nearby grouped trees, a long
pole was quickly cut and placed beneath this square of hides
and a shelter was completed, the pole raising the center of the
square about the four corners and causing the rain to run
down the sides.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Lagross and Jose had gathered firewood, being
careful to split the branches to expose the dry inside halves of the
wood. Soon a warm, drying fire was going. Jose whistled and El
Trumpitero came to the shelter and Jose removed from the
saddle bag two bottles of wine, some cheese and a loaf of brown,
hard bread.</p>
<p>Guiterez spoke as he passed one bottle of the wine to the
two women, &ldquo;For you Senora and Senorita, one bottle of the
priests&rsquo; wine, which is the reason I am here. I had gone to the
Post Jean Baptiste des Natchitoches to get wine for the priests,
Father Certa and Father Balligo. The bread from the good
miller, Sieur Le Renaudiere, baked by Jacques Turpeaux, was
sold to me by the good Doctor Bonnafons at Sieur Barme&rsquo;s
<span class="pb" id="Page_69">69</span>
Store; I bought the cheese, which was brought to Nachitoches
by Joseph Lattier, from the two Barberousses who have a trading
post among the Yatasse Indians at El Campti. It is wonderful
the Lord has granted man the power to prepare food in
such a way that it is preserved for future consumption, here we
sit on the Arroyo Hondo and enjoy a meal just as if we were
sitting in our own homes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While they were eating Guiterez had become conscious of the
beauty of Francine Manuella. She seemed to have inherited all
the beauty of both the Indian and French races. Here thought
Jose is the woman for me, this one I intend to make my wife.
Jose thought of the dowry and wondered if Lagross had provided
such for his daughter. He knew this young maiden would
be the ideal helpmate in his future business because she could
speak French, Spanish and the Caddo languages.</p>
<p>Jose decided that he would make his intentions known to
Lagross. Both the Lagross and Guiterez families had known
each other for many years, and he felt that there was at least a
bond of more than business, so he decided to ask Lagross&rsquo; assistance
in obtaining this land east of the Arroyo Hondo. He began
explaining his idea to the French trader about building a kind
of trading post, and eating place which would have accommodations
to sleep weary travelers. Lagross liked the young Spaniard&rsquo;s
idea and told him so, but, said Lagross, &ldquo;one would need a
wife to make such a venture complete.&rdquo; At this Jose made his
intentions toward the trader&rsquo;s daughter clear by stating that
he wished perhaps that he might have permission to pay court to
his daughter. Lagross did not seem surprised of Guiterez&rsquo; intentions,
as many had asked for his daughter. &ldquo;My daughter,&rdquo; said
Lagross, &ldquo;has had many suitors, some offered marriage and
some only a proposition. You understand how some of the French
and Spanish regard a half breed woman, however, those who
offered a proposition now wear the mark of the short leather
whip she always carries. As for my permission to pay court to
my daughter, that is entirely up to her, she is certainly old
enough to be married, according to other young women her age
in this area. Many fathers of young girls are now pampering
<span class="pb" id="Page_70">70</span>
a grandchild. Francine is a very head-strong woman and it will
take an unusual man to win her hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meanwhile Francine, listening to this conversation, was
amused, and first inclined to be angry, but then she thought,
Jose offered marriage, not just a proposition as many had done.
Guiterez cut quite a figure, either astride El Trumpitero or
afoot, so this man might be just the one for her, but she wondered
if his talk about the Three Cabins was not just so much talk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jose Guiterez&rdquo;, said Francine, &ldquo;Jose Guiterez, a <i>mestizo</i>,
a half breed, wishes the hand of Francine Manuella Lagross, who
is also a half breed; Guiterez who talks big and has nothing to
offer a wife but an assumption of what he intends to do; my
father who sits there agreeing with him while he drinks the
Priests&rsquo; wine and talks about me as though I were some sort of
trade-goods; my mother sits there nodding her head in agreement,
as if she would be glad to get rid of me; all of you talking
as if I would have nothing to do with the situation. Do you think,
Jose, that you can offer my father and mother wine, bread and
cheese, that would be sufficient to win me as a wife? I notice that
El Trumpitero does not have a whip mark on his hide, that the
bit in his mouth is not the cruel Spanish bit used by the dragoons;
you do not have the sharp Spanish spurs on your boots, do you
think you can bend me to your will as you have El Trumpitero?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Ha,&rdquo; she laughed, &ldquo;that would be something to see. Now,
mestizo, I have a proposition. The moon will be full tonight. If
on the third full moon from this one, there are three cabins here
on the Arroyo Hondo, then I will be your wife. If not I will have
El Trumpitero, the horse I will ride when I leave here, you can
use mine. You see, I know you have no money, no land to sell
and no possible way to stock such a building with trade-goods
and in the meantime you will not have El Trumpitero which is
the only thing of value you do have; now Senor Jose Guiterez
what do you say to that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Guiterez, &ldquo;for so small a woman you certainly
have a large mouth, but first I must do this.&rdquo; He quickly grabbed
Francine and put her across his knee as one would do a spoiled
child and spanked her soundly. &ldquo;First,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;for talking so
<span class="pb" id="Page_71">71</span>
to her parents and second, that she should show more respect to
the man she is going to marry; third, he was holding her to her
proposition; fourth, that if, when she was released, she struck
him with her whip, he would use the whip on her so thoroughly
that she would not be able to sit down for the three moons
which she had previously mentioned.&rdquo; Lagross roared with
laughter as his squaw whispered to him that Francine had finally
met her match.</p>
<p>The rain had ceased and the group headed for Natchitoches,
Francine astride El Trumpitero and Guiterez astride the horse
of Francine. Not much was said until the train had reached the
top of the steep hill called Grand Montania. Jose remarked that
the horse of Francine had probably had the same temperament
as her owner and she undoubtedly bit and kicked. Francine, not
without a retort, stated that M. St. Denis could not grant land to
a Spaniard, he would be a fool if he did, El Trumpitero was as
good as hers right now. Guiterez said he had one thing that Francine
had overlooked when she stated her proposition and that
she was as good as married to him right now. So the two passed
the time on the way to Natchitoches arguing with each other.</p>
<p>At Natchitoches Guiterez went to Sieur Barme&rsquo;s Store and
obtained more wine for the priests at Los Adais. He then went
to see St. Denis and told him of the occurrences of the day, and
his intentions. St. Denis said, &ldquo;I have no authority to do this
other than to a Frenchman.&rdquo; &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Madame St. Denis,
who had evidently been eavesdropping on the conversation,
&ldquo;since when has M. De St. Denis ever questioned the word
&lsquo;authority&rsquo;, especially in such a matter advantageous to the
French as well as the Spanish, not to mention the extra profits
in commissions to be received from trade goods sold Guiterez
at this prospective trading post.&rdquo; &ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; said St. Denis,
&ldquo;you underestimate me. I merely stated that I did not have
the authority, I did not say that I would see that Guiterez did
not get the land. Now go quickly and send someone to fetch
Sieur Barme.&rdquo; When Sieur Barme arrived St. Denis explained
all to him. &ldquo;Now&rdquo;, said St. Denis to Barme, &ldquo;I will sell to you
10 arpents of land at the base of Grand Montania this side of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_72">72</span>
Arroyo Hondo for ten percent of the first year&rsquo;s profits of the
first year that this new trading post is in operation. I will sell
this land to you in the name of the King of France, what you
do with this land is your business. Now, Senor Guiterez wishes
to buy some land, on this land he intends to build a trading post
called The Three Cabins. If you wish to sell this land to Senor
Guiterez for ten percent of the profits of his first year&rsquo;s business,
you would be in accord with the law to do so. As far as
merchandise for this said trading post I am sure your store
could supply the necessary merchandise. As for payment, I am
sure Senor Guiterez can be trusted, and as for security there
would be the dowry given by Jean Lagross. If you are in agreement
I will send for the Notary and draw up the papers. In the
meantime you can issue a bill of sale to Senor Guiterez for the
land.&rdquo; Addressing Guiterez, &ldquo;Senor, you now own 10 arpents of
land, but building the three cabins in the allotted time will take
some doing. In the meantime you have many friends here at
Natchitoches and I will see that they know about your problem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Back at Los Adais Guiterez obtained an interview with the
Governor, Winthuisin, to ask for permission to establish the
Three Cabins on the French side of the Arroyo Hondo. The
Governor at Los Adais agreed to Guiterez&rsquo; request. Almazon
had settled the question that the Arroyo Hondo was the boundary
between the territories of France and Spain, and any Governor
could give away land which did not belong to his country.
Guiterez now had the sanction of both the French and the
Spanish. When he explained all the details to his family and his
many Spanish friends, all turned to with willing hands and the
wilderness of the Arroyo Hondo rang with the echoes of many
axes. Indians and Frenchmen from Natchitoches brought food
and extra assistance. In less than the first moon two of the
cabins were completed. Guiterez had Father Certa at Los Adais
begin reading the banns for matrimony, and on the fourth
Sunday Francine came down the steep trail of Grand Montania
and looked at The Three Cabins finished and stocked with trade
goods.</p>
<p>As the two left The Three Cabins to go to Los Adais to be
<span class="pb" id="Page_73">73</span>
wed, Guiterez said to Francine, &ldquo;Remember when you are estimating
my values, I told you I had one thing that you had
forgotten to name, that one thing was friends.&rdquo; &ldquo;So you have&rdquo;,
said Francine, &ldquo;but did you not wonder where so much food came
from to feed those who were building the three cabins, I am not
without friends&rdquo;, and she smiled, &ldquo;so, my high and mighty
Guiterez, I think we are going to make a good match. Many of

<br /><span class="h2line2">AFTER ST. DENIS</span></h2>
<p>In 1743 Justo Bonev y Morales was sent to replace Winthuisin
as Governor. Morales, a Knight of the Order of Santiago, was a
man befitting the ideals of St. Denis, who was now a Knight of
the Order of St. Louis. These two visited often, two knights on a
tiny western frontier. By now the French and Spanish had intermarried
frequently so that the Arroyo Hondo barrier stood in
name only.</p>
<p>On June 11, 1744, St. Denis died. Morales came to offer his
condolences as did many from Los Adais. Indians and slaves alike
bowed their heads to the memory of this man.</p>
<p>Governor Morales, in keeping with the false cold front of
diplomacy, wrote his superiors, &ldquo;St. Denis is dead, thank God,
now we can breathe easier&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Captain Caesar de Blanc, a son-in-law of St. Denis, was
appointed Post Commandante at Natchitoches and in the same
year, 1744, Governor Morales was replaced by Francois Garcia
Larios. These two men had no outstanding quarrels, for during
these four years both the French and the Spanish prospered,
crops were favorable and the trail from Los Adais was traveled
daily by each of the nationalities. The Natchitoches area was
prosperous and shipped to New Orleans, tobacco, cattle, horses
and other farm products. Even those farmers at Los Adais were
selling to the New Orleans market. Young Gil Y. Barbo was
importing wild cattle and horses, obtained from the plains of
Texas, driven over El Camino Real to the Adais-Natchitoches
frontier, and on to New Orleans.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>There was a working agreement between Juan de Mora and
Lt. Derbonne, now retired from the French army and a civilian,
farmer, trader and exporter of note in the Natchitoches post
area.</p>
<p>In 1748 Pedro del Barrios Jacinto y Esprilla, an Alcolade of
the Santo Hernando of all New Spain, was appointed the new
Governor of Los Adais. The humdrum life of the frontier was too
much for the new Governor so he gave up his position to Jacinto
de Barrios y Gauregui in 1750. Barrios remained as governor
until 1759, having had the fortitude to be Governor of Los Adais
for a longer span of time than any of his predecessors. By now
third generation Spaniards were being born on the Texas
frontier from San Antonio De Bexar to Los Adais. These people
were experiencing a new freedom not felt anywhere else in New
Spain. They now regarded this land of Texas as their own. The
seat of government was too far away to exercise a cloistered,
ruling hand over them.</p>
<p>In 1759 Angle de Martos y Navarette replaced Jacinto Barrios
as Governor of Los Adais. Navarette was a merchant and
began to liven the frontier. Up to this time the French were
supplying the area with all needed material, but when the new
Governor came, fine Spanish lace, woolens and linen, finer than
any which had previously been offered for sale on the frontier,
and nails, which had always been scarce on the frontier, became
plentiful.</p>
<p>In 1762 Louis XV gave Louisiana to his cousin Charles III of
Spain.</p>
<p>In 1762 Caesar De Blanc was replaced at Natchitoches by
Adrian Francois Le Doux as Post Commandante. He was in turn
replaced by Angelus La Perrier in 1764. Perrier was the Commandante
who received the first Catholic nuns to arrive in
Natchitoches; thus 1765 marked the date of the beginning of
formal scholastic training in the area.</p>
<p>Through his merchandising endeavors on this French-Spanish
frontier Navarette had amassed for himself an estimated
eighty thousand dollar fortune. In 1767 Don Hugo
O&rsquo;Connor was appointed Governor of the Adais and Texas country,
<span class="pb" id="Page_76">76</span>
and in November of that year, on the seventh day, Commandante
La Perrier had the sad responsibility of turning over the
Natchitoches Post to Don Antonio Ulloa representing the
Spanish Government. In this same year O&rsquo;Connor received a
visitor, Padre Jose de Solice, who kept a diary of his visitation
which was translated by Reverend Peter T. Forristal and was
published as one of the preliminary studies of the Texas-Coahuila
Historical Society.</p>
<p>Father Solice records the work of the priests of the Mission
de Los Adais. There were 256 baptisms, 64 marriages and 116
burials. At the Natchitoches Post he found records of 20 baptisms,
13 marriages and 15 burials. (Natchitoches was quite
often without the services of a priest and the padres of Los Adais
supplied their spiritual needs).</p>
<p>Also, in 1767 Athanase De Mezieres, a Frenchman, was
appointed Commandante of Post St. Jean Baptiste Des Natchitoches.</p>
<p>In 1770 Baron de Ripperda was appointed Governor of Los
Adais and it befell his duty to see to the evacuation of Presidio
Senors del Pilar de Los Adais. The Spanish authorities decided
that now that the Louisiana Territory was entirely under Spanish
jurisdiction, this presidio was no longer necessary.<a class="fn" id="fr_9" href="#fn_9">[9]</a></p>
<p>Ripperda issued orders that all settlers and army personnel
were to be ready in three days to leave the area. Many of the
farmers fled to the Natchitoches area with their families and
worldly goods.</p>
<p>With Natchitoches now the seat of Government of the Texas
area westward to San Antonio, El Camino Real was lengthened
at least fifteen miles in extent from Natchitoches to Mexico
City. De Mezieres had under his jurisdiction an area extending
from Post Du Rapides (Alexandria) to the Ataquapois in Oklahoma
southward to San Antonio.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>The inhabitants of Los Adais and those residing around the
missions in the Nacogdoches area were rebellious and Baron
Ripperda extended his ultimatum to five days.</p>
<p>Antonio Gil y Barbo and Gil Flores became the heroes of
the evacuation of Los Adais, some five hundred men, women and
children moved to the vicinity of San Antonio. The former
inhabitants of El Camino Real were not happy. They longed for
the fertile soil and forests which abounded in wild game of the
East Texas and West Louisiana area. Flores and y Barbo were
sent with a petition to the Viceroy of Mexico. The two returned
with the news that the people would be allowed to settle in a new
area. They moved to a settlement on the Trinity River at Robbins
Crossing, the present day location in Madison County, Texas.</p>
<p>Floods and the danger of hostile Indians soon forced the
settlers to seek a new environment. They moved eastward to
Nacogdoches under the leadership of y Barbo. There in 1779
was established the Town of Nacogdoches.</p>
<p>Y Barbo and a party of followers went back to Los Adais and
dug up four of the six cannon buried there just prior to the
evacuation of the area. They returned to Nacogdoches and re-established
La Presidio de Neustra Senora de Los Delores de
Nacogdoches and in the same year Antonio Gil y Barbo was
appointed Commandante of the Presidio.</p>
<p>At Natchitoches in 1773 Commandante De Mezieres kept
contact with all of this vast area by assigning traders to establish
trading posts among the different Indian tribes and suppliers
were assigned to each trader:</p>
<dl class="undent"><dt>Pierre Bison was sent to the Calcasieu Indians, the supplier was Reme Poissot;</dt>
<dt>Louis Pablo Villeneuve De Blanc to Caddoquopois, Bisadorewas to supply him;</dt>
<dt>Jose Antonio Bonetis was sent to Atachapois, this man was an independent trader;</dt>
<dt>Pierre Blot was sent to the Nacogdoches Indians and Joseph Blancpain was to supply him;</dt>
<dt>Caesar Barme was sent to the Yatasses near Campti, Louisiana;</dt></dl>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p>Nicholas Chef was an independent trader to the Tokawanes;
these were in an area fifty miles northwest of the
present-day city of Fort Worth, Texas. It was one of the
most remote trading posts from Natchitoches and De
Mezieres assigned a supply-patrol of the militia at the
Natchitoches Post to supply the necessary trade goods.
Sergeant Joseph Trichell, who had been assigned to the
Natchitoches Post in 1749, was to command the patrol which
consisted of Corporal Nicholas Tournier and an accountant,
Nicholas Le Noir. Four musketeers, Francois Hugue, Louis
Moinet, Nicholas Pent and Andries Compiere. Domingo De
Soto was to act as interpreter.</p>
<p>This patrol was responsible for the arrest of four Englishmen
who had crossed the Mississippi River and were
trading among the Tokawanes. The four men were William
Warden, John Cross, John Hamilton and Jerome Matalinche.</p>
<p>De Mezieres was vexed with Sgt. Trichell for allowing
the Englishmen to sell all of their trade goods to the
Indians and threatened him with imprisonment, but Trichell
explained that the Indians would have gone on the war
path if they had not been allowed to trade for the English
merchandise. Trichell countered with the fact that all of
the profits of the English traders were now in his hands
and that there was no difference if De Mezieres had the
trade-goods or the profits. De Mezieres paid the Englishmen
in French and Spanish coin equal to the original cost of the
merchandise, and this same patrol was ordered to escort the
Englishmen fifty miles east of Natchez before setting them
free. The Englishmen were charged with the Patrol&rsquo;s expenses.</p>
<dl class="undent"><dt>Luis de Quindise was an independent Spanish trader and was sent to the Adais Indians.</dt>
<dt>Pierre Dupain was sent to the Peticaddo;</dt>
<dt>Andre D&rsquo;Hutrive was sent to the Bidias on the Trinity River;</dt>
<dt>Alexis Grappe was sent to the Ais and Guierlero Lestage was to supply him.</dt></dl>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>In 1770 DeMezieres following St. Denis&rsquo; method of keeping
peace with the Indians, invited the Chiefs to come and stand before
him at Post Du Natchitoches to receive presents in the name
of the King of Spain. Along El Camino Real traveled such great
Chiefs as:</p>
<dl class="undent"><dt>Tinhioune, Chief of the Caddoquopois.</dt>
<dt>Santo, head Chief of the Bidias and Don Melchor, otherwise called Gorgorritos, a sub Chief of the Bidias.</dt>
<dt>Quirotaches, Chief of the Nacogdoches Indians.</dt>
<dt>Christobal, Chief of the Taouaizes.</dt>
<dt>Vigotos, head Chief of the Hasinai Federation of Indians.</dt></dl>
<p>Thus, by gaining the friendship and allegiance of the most
important Indian Chiefs of the territory, DeMezieres established
an easy feeling between the Indians and the Spanish Government.</p>
<p>As of February 16, 1776 DeMezieres sent this Census Report
to Unzaga, Governor at New Orleans:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>113 homes; 105 heads of families with 86 women; 77 youths
able to bear arms; 106 infants; 34 unmarried women; 84
bachelors and non residents engaged in hunting and fishing
and trade with the Indians; 2 male and 2 female free people of
color; 2 male and 1 female mulattos; 410 Indian and negro
slaves (men, women and children); 277 pieces of fire arms;
1258 head horses, 842 head cattle, 3000 head sheep and goats
and 783 hogs and 481 mules. There was shipped from
Natchitoches: 1000 head horses; 100 mules; 9 quintals of
indigo; 15 fenegas of indigo seed; 30,000 packages of
tobacco; 120 buffalo hides; 36,000 deer hides; 5000 ambrias
of bear oil; 5000 pounds of tallow, quantities of bacon and
meats, both salted and dried.</p>

<br /><span class="h2line2">AFTER THE LOUISIANA PURCHASE</span></h2>
<p>In 1802 Louisiana was ceded back to France by Spain by the
Treaty of Ildefonso. On May 2, 1803 Livingston and Monroe
signed with Barbe-Marbois the purchase treaty which was dated
back to April 30, 1803; thus Louisiana became a possession of the
United States.</p>
<p>Spain did not approve of the sale of Louisiana and decided to
reclaim all of the land originally occupied prior to the time when
Louisiana was ceded to Spain.</p>
<p>There was a movement of Spanish soldiers under the command
of General Hurrera as far as Nacogdoches and from there
patrols were sent across the Sabine River.</p>
<p>Fort Claiborne, established in 1805 at Natchitoches by orders
of General Wilkinson, was occupied by several companies of
the Second Infantry of the United States Army under the command
of Major Porter.</p>
<p>Dr. John Sibley had been appointed Indian Agent for this
area of the Southwestern Frontier by Governor Claiborne. Dr.
Sibley had been keeping an account of the Spanish patrol movements
east of the Sabine River through contact with the Indians
of the area. On February 2, 1806, he sent a letter to Major
Moses Porter at Fort Claiborne saying that there was a detachment
of Spanish militia encamped at Juan Mora&rsquo;s Lagoon, also
known as Conichi Ranch, one league east of Los Adais on Bayou
Dupont.</p>
<p>Lt. Piatt was sent with a letter to Nacogdoches, demanding
<span class="pb" id="Page_81">81</span>
that all Spanish patrols east of the Sabine River retire immediately
to the west bank of that stream.</p>
<p>Captain Edward D. Turner left for the Los Adais area with
a detachment of soldiers on February 5, 1806. The Spanish
patrol was contacted and Captain Turner delivered the ultimatum
of Major Porter that it retire to the west bank of the
Sabine River.<a class="fn" id="fr_10" href="#fn_10">[10]</a></p>
<p>This document from the U. S. Army records shows the result
of that meeting: The beginning of the Neutral Strip.</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">At the Adais</p>
<p class="t0">February 6, 1806.</p>
</div>
<p>I, Joseph Maria Gonzalez, commandante of his most
Catholic Majesty&rsquo;s troops on this side of the Rio Sabinas,
hereby having agreed with Captain Edward D. Turner,
Captain in the United States Army, to return all troops of
his Catholic Majesty&rsquo;s to the other side of the said Rio
Sabinas, as soon as my horses will permit it or in five days,
or at the most six, and to make my march this day and I
also oblige myself to not send any more patrols on this side
of the Rio Sabinas.</p>
<p><span class="lr">Signed: Ensign Joseph Maria Gonzalez</span>
<span class="lr">Witness: John V. Duforest (Interpreter)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The above document was the result of an agreement establishing
a no-man&rsquo;s land between the Arroyo Hondo and the
Sabine River, which neither the United States Government nor
the Mexican Government would use, until a final settlement
could be reached between the two said governments about a
boundary. This agreement was made by two young officers
representing their respective countries, both willing to fight
for their countries, but both having the intelligence and initiative
to declare a stalemate to prevent a war.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>This forty mile wide strip of land became known as the
Neutral Strip, and in it gathered the lawless of both countries.
Even so, from within this lawless area were to come men who
would strike the first blow for Texas independence.</p>
<p>In 1807 several slaves of Louis Derbonne and other planters
owning land adjoining the Neutral Strip, fled into the Neutral
Strip and from there they went to Nacogdoches and on to
Trinidad de Salcedo on the Trinity River, where they were given
refuge by the Spanish Government.</p>
<p>On September 5, 1807, Don Manuel de Salcedo, Governor of
Texas at Nacogdoches, received a letter saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The planters of the Natchitoches area are threatening to
organize a force of 250 men to go after slaves known to
be in the Texas area of Nacogdoches and at Trinidad de
Salcedo unless the slaves are returned.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The letter reminded the Spanish Governor of Article XX of the
treaty between the United States and Mexico which said fugitive
slaves must be returned to their owners. The letter was signed
by Judge John Carr, and Justices Rouquier and Paillette.</p>
<p>The above letter and a letter from Governor Claiborne
brought about the desired results. The governor might have been
influenced by the knowledge of the Phillip Nolan filibustering
expedition in 1800 which spent itself at Waco-Texas vicinity.
Nolan had for several years traveled westward from the Alexandria,
Louisiana area and established a trail straight westward
into the Texas-San Antonio area, where he was trading for and
capturing wild horses and cattle. This trail later became known
as Nolan&rsquo;s Trace.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<h2 id="c12"><span class="h2line1">XI</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE DEVIL&rsquo;S PLAY GROUND</span></h2>
<p>When Generals Wilkinson and Herrera agreed to the boundaries
set by their two junior officers, Turner and Gonzalez, they
created a back door to the United States of a forty-mile-wide
strip which was to become one of the most lawless places that
ever existed within the confines of the United States.</p>
<p>Every outlaw and murderer made this Neutral Strip his
destination, The Free State of Sabine, it was called. Neither
Spain nor the United States wished to have the responsibility
or the expense of policing this outlaw state, although the southland&rsquo;s
busiest road cut through the center of it. But traffic was
heavy just the same. Many found that the only safe way to cross
the strip was to travel in force, therefore, either at Natchitoches
or on the west side of Sabine River, the travelers waited until
a large enough group was gathered to guarantee safe travel.</p>
<p>The outlaws of the Strip dealt in horse stealing, cattle rustling,
counterfeiting, or any other form of crime that might
strike their fancy. There is no definite data or history of the
goings-on inside the area, but many men who lived in, or traveled
through the district recorded their experiences in diaries and
stories or just handed down hearsay tales of the happenings in
this lawless land. There, a person&rsquo;s security was strapped at
his hips or carried in his hands in the form of pistols, long
rifles or knives. Even the long, rawhide whip was considered a
deadly weapon in the hands of an expert.</p>
<p>Los Adais was a waystation and on the bulletin board appeared
one day a word with a new meaning, Sabina 28, the same
<span class="pb" id="Page_84">84</span>
sign appeared on the Rendezvous Oak at Natchitoches. To the
average citizen it meant nothing, but to those in the know it
meant slaves would be for sale at a point near Pendleton at the
ferry on Sabine River on the 28th of that month.</p>
<p>With the discovery of a new way to granulate sugar and with
the invention of the cotton gin, the land around Los Adais and
Natchitoches became highly productive when planted in sugar
cane and cotton and more slaves were needed, but the United
States had forbidden their importation.</p>
<p>To Jean Lafitte, the pirate, the Sabine River with the protection
of the Neutral Strip, became the back door to the United
States. Slaves for wagon loads of food were commonly exchanged,
according to the statements of a Mr. Tulley at Los Adais and Mr.
Gunlineau at Natchitoches. Lafitte needed food for his pirate
operations. Up the Sabine River the boats were pulled, poled
or paddled by the slaves to be sold. From the Los Adais and
Natchitoches areas came wagon loads of food, smoked hams,
kegs of salted bacon, cornmeal, kegs of molasses, wine, corn
whiskey, dried beans, peppers, tobacco, sweet potatoes and
gourds of honey, with spiced cake sent by hopeful wives to the
pirates so that their husbands might make more profitable deals.</p>
<p>Back on the same wagons came the slaves, bolts of cloth,
jewelry and perfume (Lafitte&rsquo;s storehouses was filled with goods
from every Spanish and British ship that he could capture).
Everything was legal as far as the bills of sale went. A certain
honest merchant in New Orleans, with a good reputation and
scruples, signed blank bills of sale, to be filled in by Tulley and
Gunlineau.</p>
<p>This may seem rather crude to the average reader&mdash;the
smuggling of slaves and the ladies sending spiced goods to the
pirates on the Sabine River. At this very time the United States
was confiscating where it could slaves that had been smuggled
in, selling them and giving the informers half of the proceeds
of the sales. Nothing was said about putting the slaves on a
boat and returning them to their homeland. (Question: Are there
very many people today who try to beat the Income Tax?)
There was some good to come out of all this. Lafitte assisted
<span class="pb" id="Page_85">85</span>
the United States in the defense of New Orleans in the war
of 1812, furnishing men, ammunition and food. Where did he
obtain the food? From the Los Adais and Natchitoches area.
Lafitte, Tulley and Gunlineau were merely supplying the demand
for a necessary merchandise and certainly the slaves were better
off because of it.</p>
<p>Noah Smithwick, who had visited the Strip, wrote of the
murders, robberies and numerous violations of law there. He
gives us one tale that falls in line with the demand and supply of
the times. Because the man he wrote about was still alive he
calls this character, John Doe. Doe was a counterfeiter of money,
especially the Mexican silver dollar. The people at that time had
no &ldquo;jingling&rdquo; money for their pockets and Doe supplied this
demand, with a silver-coated copper coin. Because of a slight
flaw in the press the coins were easily identified and called Doe&rsquo;s
dollars.</p>
<p>An Indian approached Doe one day and handed him one of the
counterfeit dollars requesting that Doe put a new skin on it. Doe
obliged by giving the Indian a new counterfeit dollar for the old
one, explaining to the Indian that dollars were like snakes, they
always shed their skins. Doe&rsquo;s dollars, although not recognized
outside the Strip, were regarded as legal tender therein.</p>
<p>It was said that Doe&rsquo;s dollars were of more handsome design
than the original Mexican Eagle Silver Dollar.</p>
<p>Doe, however, minted pure silver dollars of the same design.
He mixed enough of these with the bogus dollars so that on occasion
when a dollar was questioned and the dollar tested, it was
found to be of pure silver.</p>
<p>Doe, like all counterfeiters, wished to extend his operations
but he wandered out of the Strip on the American side and was
arrested.</p>
<p>Every old place has its ghost story and &ldquo;Spanish Town&rdquo; is
no exception:</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>A young Spaniard had successfully traveled the Strip,
bringing with him wealth and many fine cloths. He settled at
Spanish Town and became the target of every single maiden
there. Mariea Guiterriz, who had many suitors, won his heart.
Anyone attempting to pay court to her ran the risk of losing his
life in a duel with other jealous suitors. Immediately after the
wedding at the reception a disappointed lover insulted the groom.
Swords flashed, Mariea rushed between the duelists, a sword
stabbed her&mdash;not a serious wound all were assured but infection
set in and she grew worse. An old Indian gave some herbs to the
young Spaniard with instructions how to use them to stop the
infection. &ldquo;Boil these herbs together over a small fire, the odor
of the brew will change and when the odor is this&rdquo;, the Indian
allowed the Spaniard to smell the brew, &ldquo;remember the odor
because now will be the time to soak the poultice with the solution&rdquo;,
then the Indian was gone.</p>
<p>The young husband followed the instructions and Mariea
began to improve, but the herbs ran out and the Indian could
not be found. Mariea sickened again. The Spaniard went to the
creek banks and the marshy places searching for the herbs,
building countless tiny fires, brewing grasses and leaves, trying
to re-discover the combination of herbs that would produce the
exact odor he was seeking.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>Mariea&rsquo;s infection worsened and she died. The young man&rsquo;s
mind, not able to grasp the reality that his love had gone, became
affected. His brain ceased to function past the last day that he
had left her, assuring her that this would be the day that he
would discover the correct blend of the herbs. From that time
on, fires, tiny fires could be seen on the creek banks in the
swamps and on the hillsides&mdash;a lover, true and devoted, still seeking
the odor that would save the life of his beloved wife.</p>
<p>The crazy Spaniard, they called him, and those who came in
contact with him, those who knew the details of his sad story,
made the Sign of the Cross when he passed and silently said a
prayer for him.</p>
<p>Night and day he searched for the elusive odor, always
searching. Those of his age, grew old and died, and so did their
sons and grandsons, but the legend lived on.</p>
<p>Some say they can still see him in his never-ending search,
smartly dressed as he kneels by a tiny fire, others say he is old,
dirty, ragged and ugly; but all say there is no need to be
alarmed because this ghost walks with God.</p>
<p>If some day or night you see a tiny fire with a shadow
kneeling by it, then you, too, are walking with God, because you,
too, are one possessed of devotion and love.</p>

<br /><span class="h2line2">SATAN&rsquo;S AGENT&mdash;JOHN A. MURRELL</span></h2>
<p>One of the many buried treasures of the Sabine strip is claimed
to belong to John A. Murrell, who possessed a brilliant mind
which he used to break all the Commandments that God gave
Moses on Mount Sinai. He was the type of man who could recite
to another the entire books of the Old and New Testaments then
shoot him down in cold blood.</p>
<p>John A. Murrell was born about the year 1800 in Williams
County, Tennessee. His father was a Methodist Minister and his
mother, a mountain woman, who at that time operated a wayside
tavern. Through the teachings of his father he learned
the Gospel and through the teachings of his mother he learned
to steal. Murrell, well equipped with the knowledge of the good
and the bad often passed as a preacher. In this guise he made
his appearance in the Neutral Strip.</p>
<p>About the year 1825 Murrell went about preaching the Gospel
and at the same time was organizing a band of outlaws. At
Los Adais which was now called Spanish Town, at Twenty Mile
House or Midway Station near Fort Jesup, in the hidden caves
near Kisatchie, he established his headquarters and from these
places he ranged out of the Strip to preach to the more populated
communities.</p>
<p>Murrell could mimic the voices of many people and was an
excellent actor. In each community where he preached he adapted
their tone of voice and mannerisms. One of his favorite gospels
was the one he called &ldquo;Directions&rdquo;. As he addressed his audience
he may have been standing in the pulpit of a church, or atop a
<span class="pb" id="Page_90">90</span>
stump or standing in the bed of a wagon, wherever a crowd
gathered Murrell felt that he should preach to them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Directions,&rdquo; he would shout, &ldquo;always when one begins a
journey, he has a destination. The road to this destination is
similar to the Road of Life, often along this road one has to
inquire about directions, and it is so through the Journey of
Life, one must follow directions laid down by the Church and the
Ministers, they are the sign posts that point the way. Quite often
a man while traveling this road, decides to take a short cut,
instead of following the Good Book as laid down by the Church,
these short cuts become his mis-deeds or his sins.</p>
<p>We shall assume that this Bible is the Book of Judgment and
in it will be the names of every living person on the face of the
earth. By each name there are two columns, one for his assets
or his good deeds of life and the other column for his mis-deeds,
which we shall call his de-sets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From here on Murrell becomes the actor in what he called,
The Drama at the Gates of Heaven.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Batiste had made the journey through life and was knocking
on the Gates of Heaven, a voice from within asks, who knocks?
Batiste answers and gives his full name. The voice is that of St.
Peter who looks up Batiste&rsquo;s record of life in the Book of Judgment.
Then St. Peter explains to Batiste, we take out the pages
which contain your assets and place them on one side of the
scales of justice and on the other side we place the pages of your
de-sets. If your assets out-weigh your de-sets, then naturally
you can come in, as we place your assets and de-sets upon the
scales we will review them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(Now Murrell becomes the comic for the benefit of his
audience). &ldquo;Right here Batiste on May 25, you done de-setted
enough to carry over on the next three pages. Boy, you was really
de-setting that day.</p>
<p>Here, we see your Pastor found you hunting on Sunday and
you had a nice bag of squirrels, the Pastor spoke to you about it
and you gave the excuse that you had your days mixed up. Again
he caught you fishing on Sunday and a nice bunch you had too,
you gave the excuse that you had your days mixed up again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>Now, if you had given the Pastor some of those squirrels or
fish, then those de-sets of that day would have turned into
assets. But all along the Road of Life you gave the excuse that
you had your days mixed up. &lsquo;Now,&rsquo; said St. Peter, as he looked
at the scales, &lsquo;because you had your days mixed up you now have
your directions mixed up. You all done come the wrong way&rsquo;, and
he shut the door in Batiste&rsquo;s face. Batiste begged for another
chance but this could not be, as you know you can only travel
the Road of Life once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Along the Neutral Strip the inhabitants catered only to hard
money, that is gold and silver coins, and Murrell asked that
fees for his service be paid in coin.</p>
<p>Murrell would place a set of balancing scales where everyone
could see, on one side he placed the Bible, then he said, &ldquo;this
Bible will represent the Book of Judgment and I place it on this
side of the scales, it will represent your mis-deeds or de-sets.
Now, we are all going to stay here until you people give enough
to tip these scales to the asset side.&rdquo; While the collections were
being made, Murrell would be expounding of the good things he
intended doing with the money, he even had a few henchmen in
the audience to begin the contributions and to urge the others
to do the same.</p>
<p>Murrell becomes another legend of Los Adais and of his
hidden treasures, it is believed that he had many hidden
treasures which he called large banks and small banks.</p>
<p>No one is certain how Murrell&rsquo;s death came about. Murrell&rsquo;s
gold and silver, and he must have had much of it, with nearly
a decade of preaching, lying, robbing and murdering in the strip,
could have been the cause.</p>

<br /><span class="h2line2">THE BREAK-UP OF THE NEUTRAL STRIP</span></h2>
<p>There were rumors in 1806 that Aaron Burr was attempting to
organize the settlers of the Neutral Strip and that an actual Free
State of Sabine was to be established, Breastworks at Sabine-Town
and a Block House with two companies of the United
States militia were established near the confluence of Bayou
Negrett and the Sabine River on the El Camino Real.</p>
<p>The establishment of the Block House by General Wilkinson
resulted in the Spanish bolstering their strength in the western
part of the Neutral Strip by giving presents to the Indians and
thereby establishing an Indian barrier in the area.</p>
<p>The gifts amounted to two thousand seven hundred-nine
pesos from the Mexican Government to be given at Nacogdoches.
The Indians received muskets, lead, powder, shot, knives, razors,
scissors, combs, mirrors, glass beads, war paint, copper and
iron pots, ribbons, coats, bells, needles, belt buckles, ramrods,
cotton goods and rum. The Indians asked for tobacco which was
not available, but five hundred eighty-nine pounds of tobacco
twists were smuggled from Natchitoches through the Neutral
Strip to Nacogdoches by orders of Manuel de Salcedo, the Governor.
Although trade was forbidden on El Camino Real by
the Spanish from French Louisiana there was a continuous
stream of contraband goods being smuggled into Texas. The
&ldquo;Contraband Trail&rdquo; ran parallel to the El Camino Real about
four miles distant from the El Camino Real, but crossing it intermittently
in areas that were uninhabited.</p>
<p>The Americans retaliated by supplying the Takuays and the
Towanoni with articles of trade and a blacksmith shop so they
<span class="pb" id="Page_93">93</span>
could sharpen the knives and scissors obtained as presents from
the Spanish.</p>
<p>Outlaws left the Neutral Strip to raid isolated farms and
plantations. Slave stealing and cattle rustling were not overlooked.
The citizens complained to the United States Government.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Augustus McGee and Lieutenant Zebulon M. Pike
were ordered to disperse the bandits of the Neutral Strip. The
orders of General Hampton expressed a desire for cooperation
from the Spanish at Nacogdoches. A detachment under Captain
Bernardino Mantero was sent from Nacogdoches to assist Captain
W. H. Overton, who was at that time the senior officer at
Fort Claiborne, issued orders for the clearance of the strip on
March 5, 1812. The military only succeeded in destroying the
hideouts which were occupied by the bandits by burning everything
in sight. The bandits knew every sneak trail of the Neutral
Strip and were successful in avoiding the policing parties.</p>
<p>By the year 1821 the Anglo-American Civilization had
crossed in substantial numbers the Mississippi River in two
main divisions, Louisiana and Missouri.</p>
<p>General Edmund Pendleton Gaines considered that the most
vital and important area of the southwest was: &ldquo;The Southern
section of the Western Frontier, from the mouth of the Sabine
River eastward to the Red River and thence to the Mexican
boundary at a point where the western boundary intersects the
Sabine River.&rdquo;</p>
<p>General Jackson had transferred General Gaines, at that
time commanding the Florida frontier, to the western frontier
in 1817. General Gaines was aware of the constant unrest of
the so-called &ldquo;neutral strip,&rdquo; known as &ldquo;The Free State of Sabine&rdquo;
and <i>No Man&rsquo;s Land</i>.</p>
<p>The proclamation of the Treaty of Washington in 1821 fixed
the western boundary of the United States as the Sabine River,
thus the agreement with the Mexican Republic transferred the
Neutral Strip to the United States.</p>
<p>General Gaines was aware of the feeling of those settlers
from the Sabine River westward along El Camino Real to the
<span class="pb" id="Page_94">94</span>
Rio Grande near Eagle Pass, Texas. These were Spaniards that
had felt the freedom of being so far from their government&rsquo;s
head in Mexico City. They, with the Anglo-American settlers,
wanted a different kind of freedom, not allegiance to Mexico
or to the United States. Thus, the Fort Jesup-Natchitoches and
El Camino Real Area on the eastern end from Nacogdoches and
San Augustine was ripe for the filibusterers.</p>
<p>There were many in this area, Gaines was certain, who did
not recognize the Treaty of Washington, Frenchmen of the fifth
and sixth generations who had settled this area, likewise the
Spanish, and the Indians for countless generations before either
of the other two nationalities.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This land &rsquo;tis mine&mdash;&rsquo;tis yours&mdash;&rsquo;tis mine,&rdquo; said the French
and the Spanish. &ldquo;The land is mine,&rdquo; stated the United States,
&ldquo;we bought it from the French.&rdquo; The Indian declared, &ldquo;&rsquo;tis mine,
was so even before either the French or Spanish came.&rdquo; The
settlers questioned which government will recognize our claim
to the homesteads, the land grants, &ldquo;this is mine by right of
occupation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were the half-breeds, descendants of a French or Spanish
father and an Indian woman. These were demanding their
birthright. And they held sway over many Indian tribes. They
were intelligent, they could be friendly, or a ruthless enemy. But
the United States&rsquo; ownership backed by the Army soon restored
peace and order to No Man&rsquo;s Land.</p>

<h2 id="c15"><span class="h2line1">XIV</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE FILIBUSTER OF 1812-1821</span></h2>
<p>Don Jose Bernardo Maxmilliano Gutierrez de Lardo, often
called Bernardo, was a merchant and blacksmith at Revilla, a
village near the junction of the Rio Salado and the Rio Grande.
He was a follower of Padres Miguel Hidalgo y Castillo and Jose
Maria Morelos, who were encouraging a revolt among the Indian
and Indian halfbreeds called <i>mestizos</i>.</p>
<p>Gutierrez with Captain Jose Manchaca, a Texas rebel and a
deserter from the Royalist Army of Mexico, and ten others left
Revilla with thirty thousand dollars in Mexican silver. Their
objective was to reach Natchitoches, a border town on the Neutral
Strip. The money was for organizing a filibuster campaign
into Texas. They were pursued by the Royalists and were caught
up with near the village of Bayou Pierre (a village at that time
located on a road between the present-day Pleasant Hill and
Lake End on Red River). Gutierrez and Manchaca escaped but
lost the silver, finding refuge at a small trading post at Campti,
Louisiana. When they arrived in Natchitoches and began recruiting
men for the filibustering campaign they found many
ready and willing to participate. The merchants, sensing enormous
profits, offered every assistance.</p>
<p>Captain Manchaca went immediately into the Neutral Strip
to solicit recruits among the bandits, or anyone else who desired
to join the filibusterers.</p>
<p>Gutierrez wrote a letter to James Monroe, Secretary of State
in Washington, explaining that although Texas was not yet a
Republic the people of that area had all the necessary qualifications
<span class="pb" id="Page_96">96</span>
for becoming a nation, that it would be to the advantage
of the United States and the people of the future Republic of
Texas for them to seek assistance where they could find it. It
would, therefore, be advantageous to the United States, should
their undertaking be successful in overthrowing the yoke of the
Mexican Government, and Texas become a Republic.</p>
<p>Gutierrez secured letters of recommendation and two hundred
dollars from Dr. John Sibley and departed immediately for
Washington where he met with officials and made requests for
men, money, munitions and other supplies necessary for the filibustering
campaign. Gutierrez brought out the importance to
the United States of the Texas commerce. The proposal was
dropped by the officials when Gutierrez insisted that he be in
command of the expedition. However, Monroe did see the advantage
of the United States having a Republic to the west to
help guard the border, as at that time the United States was
having difficulties with Spain and England, and because of the
Florida question. Therefore the Secretary of State did offer
encouragement to Gutierrez.</p>
<p>Don Jose Alvares de Toledo was at the same time in Washington
seeking assistance for a revolution in Cuba, which if
successful, would result in the establishment of an Antillean
Confederation of the Islands. This, too, met with the approval
of Monroe, but again he offered only encouragement and no assistance.
Don Luis de Onis, the Minister from Spain, having
learned of Toledo&rsquo;s plans, conspired with Diago Correga to do
away with Toledo. Toledo, because of his failure to get the necessary
assistance he desired, cast his lot with Gutierrez. He cultivated
the friendship of General Ira A. Allen, who was looked
upon with disfavor in the State of Vermont. Allen helped Toledo
and Gutierrez by gaining the confidence and support of those
who were interested in such an adventure, namely: Samuel Alden,
a young adventurer; Aaron Mower, a printer by trade;
Evariste Calvettes, a Frenchman of unusual but intriguing reputation,
and William A. Prentis, a merchant who interested Henry
Adams Bullard in the adventure of the filibuster campaign. This
group of men, with several others departed for Natchitoches.
<span class="pb" id="Page_97">97</span>
Gutierrez in Natchitoches had enlisted under his banner, the aid
of Lieutenant August McGee, who resigned at Fort Claiborne to
join the filibusterers; Samuel Kemper, a well-known figure in
the politics of Florida; Rubin Ross, an ex-sheriff from Virginia;
Henry Perry of the Army Quartermaster; Joseph B. Wilkinson,
son of General James Wilkinson; J. McClanahan; Rubin Smith;
James Patterson; A. Cole and Alexis Grappe, traders who had
many contacts in Texas as far as San Antonio de Bexar; and
James Gaines, brother of General Gaines. The merchants in
Natchitoches hired some of the local youths, Tenoss Moinet, two
Prudhommes, Henry Derbonne, Jose Benetis, Anthony Dubois,
Peter Dolet, Michael Chesneau, Andrew Chase, Stephen Wallace,
Matthew Bonnette, Walter Young, Joseph Ruth and Chesneau
Tontin to go along to protect their interests and to bring back
the contraband which they were sure would be obtained on such
an expedition.</p>
<p>William Shaler arrived in Natchitoches almost on the heels
of Gutierrez, a special agent sent by the Secretary of State Monroe
to assist the new so called Gutierrez-McGee expedition. Shaler&rsquo;s
letters to Monroe give an excellent account of the organization
and execution of this expedition. Shaler, who had been
trained as a military man, contributed greatly to its efficiency.</p>
<p>Samuel Davenport of the firm of Davenport and Barr, licensed
traders, established themselves in the Soledad building
in Nacogdoches. Davenport wrote to Don Manuel de Salcedo,
Governor of Texas at Nacogdoches, from Natchitoches, &ldquo;John
Adair was gathering troops in Rapides (Alexandria, Louisiana)
500 men were being gathered along the Mississippi River and
at Natchez. Captain Jose Manchac has gathered over a hundred
men out of the Neutral Strip and they are now camped on the
west bank of the Sabine River.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A letter was sent from Washington to the district judge
notifying him that the United States would not sanction an organization
of men on its land which would constitute an act of
aggression against the government of another country. Judge
Carr&rsquo;s answering letter dated July 22, 1812, stated that he was
aware that some sort of movement of aggression was being
<span class="pb" id="Page_98">98</span>
talked about in the Natchitoches Area, but that to his knowledge
there were no men grouped east of the Sabine River congregating
with filibuster intent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Young men in groups of two, five, ten or fifteen arrive here
in Natchitoches every day, many are from our immediate local
area, they are mild-mannered and quiet and cause no disturbances,
they purchase supplies at the local stores and when questioned
about their destination, they declare that they are going
on a hunting trip. I have no grounds with which I can detain
such a small party of men, for to be sure groups fewer than
fifteen or twenty cannot be classed as a filibustering party. If
rumors are true and there is a location on the west bank of the
Sabine River where men are gathering with the intent of invading
Texas, that area is out of the jurisdiction of any one person
representing our local or federal government.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On August 8, 1812, the campaign began with a total strength
of one hundred eighty men.</p>
<p>At Nacogdoches was the proof that the people of the area,
according to the statements of the traders Smith, Grappe, Patterson
and McClanahan, were ready for a rebellion against the
Spanish Government. At Nacogdoches on August 11, 1812, when
the attack began, the filibusterers met only token resistance and
one hundred ninety of the inhabitants joined the patriots. The
easy fall of Nacogdoches was a shot in the arm for the filibusterers.
Fifty of the Spanish soldiers joined with the rebels. A
mule and horse train with booty of wool, hides and Spanish silverware,
estimated to be valued at one hundred thousand dollars,
was sent to Natchitoches to be exchanged for the necessary
provisions to conduct the campaign. Henry Perry of the army
quartermaster was there to receive the merchandise. Now he
had something to work with. Supplies which could not be obtained
in Natchitoches were purchased in Natchez, Mississippi.
The merchandise was brought over the old Natchez-Vidalia to
Natchitoches Indian trail (highway 84 today) which had its
share of bandits and land-pirates.</p>
<p>Gutierrez was an old hand at spreading propaganda and
at Nacogdoches the &ldquo;rebels&rdquo; paused long enough to make use
<span class="pb" id="Page_99">99</span>
of the talents of Aaron Hower, the printer. The news of the fall
of Nacogdoches would be sure to bring volunteers from the
Natchitoches-Neutral Strip area. On September 1, 1812, circulars
were found as far as San Antonio, announcing that the filibusterers
army had reached a thousand in number of well
equipped men, and that more volunteers were arriving every
hour from ten to one hundred in number to join Gutierrez, and
that they now had cannon which had been taken from the Spanish
in Nacogdoches.</p>
<p>Governor Salcedo, who had previously sent a message asking
for assistance, received news that no help could be sent because
the &ldquo;Patriot Army&rdquo; in Mexico was marching on Camargo and
Nueva Santanadar (this was a group of rebel followers of Padres
Castillo and Morelos). The propaganda news leaflets and the
news from Mexico caused Salcedo to withdraw all outlying Spanish
detachments and concentrate them at San Antonio de Bexar.
At this stage of the campaign the McGee-Gutierrez army numbered
no more than seven hundred men.</p>
<p>Now, Salcedo&rsquo;s military ability began to show. He needed
a day or two so that the troops in the west under General Herrera
could reach San Antonio. He left La Bahia (now Goliad,
Texas) without defense and spread his troops along the Guadelupe
River twenty-eight miles north and east of San Antonio.
The filibusterers could not overlook the opportunity of taking a
defenseless town. La Bahia fell without a struggle and the filibusterers
were jubilant. Meanwhile the Spanish forces met,
forming a total strength of nearly nine hundred men. Over fifty
of the Spanish soldiers with the filibusterers deserted and returned
to the Royalist troops, explaining they had been captured
and were finally able to escape.</p>
<p>Up to now McGee had been in charge of the filibusterers and
Gutierrez was the commander in name only. There was friction
between McGee and Gutierrez, and at the same time Toledo
was vying for the position of commanding them. Samuel Davenport,
the unfaithful Indian Agent of Salcedo, who had joined
the filibusterers, suddenly decided he had some important, unfinished
business and departed for Nacogdoches. A day or so
<span class="pb" id="Page_100">100</span>
later Rubin Ross left to contact Indians encamped on the Sabine
River with the intention of joining the filibusterers. McGee died
at La Bahia under mysterious circumstances. Gutierrez claimed
that McGee took poison to keep from being shot. Davenport
stated that McGee was sick when he left for Nacogdoches, and
Rubin Ross declared McGee was in good health two days prior
to his leaving Davenport, and that at no time was he aware that
McGee was sick.</p>
<p>When Ross contacted the Caddo Indians on the Sabine River
Chief Tohois refused to fight under any flag other than that
of the United States. Groups of the Alabamas, Choctaws, Conchattas
and Attapaws on learning of the refusal of Tohois also
refused to assist in the cause. However, nearly a hundred of the
warriors did join with Rubin Ross.</p>
<p>The second attack of the Royalists was also a disappointment
to Salcedo and the Spanish forces retired to San Antonio. On
March 19, Ross returned with nearly two hundred Indian, Spanish
and American volunteers and the march on San Antonio
began. They met no opposition until they reached Rosillo, about
eight miles from San Antonio; there, Samuel Kemper and Rubin
Ross led a vicious charge and the main force of the rebel drive
carried well into San Antonio.</p>
<p>The Spanish were defeated and surrendered unconditionally.
Atrocities followed under the orders of Gutierrez who had declared
himself President of the New Republic of Texas. Several
of the Spanish officers were killed, their clothing stripped from
their bodies and left exposed to the elements. The Americans
were enraged by this action. After going to the scene of the
atrocity and burying the dead, many followed the example of
Warren D. C. Hall, deserted the filibusterers and left for their
respective habitats.</p>
<p>A Junta was called after the arrival of Henry A. Bullard and
James B. Wilkinson; Major James Perry and Captains Kemper
and Ross threatened to leave with the Americans unless Gutierrez
<span class="pb" id="Page_101">101</span>
was ousted and Toledo named leader of the New Republic.<a class="fn" id="fr_11" href="#fn_11">[11]</a></p>
<p>The battle on the Madina River was the downfall of the filibusterers.
The Spanish gathered their forces under the command
of Colonels Joquine de Arrendondo y Miono and Ignacio
Elizondo.[**or Elinzondo, see below] After the battle the victors were lenient with the
many Americans they had captured. Colonel Elinzondo issued
a horse and rifle to each along with a passport for safe conduct
back to the Sabine River. The Indians were included with the
group freed, but with instructions to return to their tribes and
never take up arms against the Spanish again.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that many of these Americans were
later successful in attempting to make the Texas area a Republic.
On September 28, 1813, the first blow for Texas independence
failed, but it had been proved, however, that the Spaniards north
of the Rio Grande were influenced by the freedoms of the American
traders along El Camino Real. They had been forced to provide
for themselves from the fruits of the land, thus becoming
independent in their own right. The easy fall of Nacogdoches
was outstanding proof of their feelings.</p>

<h2 id="c16"><span class="h2line1">XV</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">FORT JESUP</span></h2>
<p>It seems odd that all that had happened in the nearly three
hundred years preceding was merely a prelude to a settlement
on a vital point, this one hill top in Sabine Parish.</p>
<p>The Caddo Nation of Indians was first to recognize the importance
of this land extending from San Antonio to Natchitoches
and settled it. What these Indians did not settle or cultivate
they commercialized, and they established trade routes
there.</p>
<p>Cabeza De Vaca and his companions came in 1530. They
claimed no land but were searching for a way out.</p>
<p>Hernando De Soto in 1541 came, but by the time he had
reached the Adais, he, too, was searching for a way out. He
claimed no land.</p>
<p>Robert de La Salle came down the Mississippi River in 1682
and claimed all land drained by that River for the King of
France. In the history of a country there is always one man who
has the imagination to see its possibilities and the ability and
push to realize his ambitions. Such a man was La Salle.</p>
<p>La Salle&rsquo;s second venture to the mouth of the Mississippi
River resulted in failure. He came by sea, missed the mouth
of the Mississippi River and settled on the coast of Texas where
he later was killed. La Salle&rsquo;s expedition, however, aroused the
Spanish of Mexico, who then began to extend their operations
further to the north.</p>
<p>Padre Hidalgo&rsquo;s letter and St. Denis&rsquo; answer resulted in the
settlement of El Camino Real from San Antonio to Natchitoches.
<span class="pb" id="Page_104">104</span>
Here, then, was cast the first seed, in form of settlers, who
learned to live as the Indians&mdash;free as the wind, this newly found
freedom had been felt by settlers and their descendants for over
a hundred years.</p>
<p>The land of Sabine, &ldquo;&rsquo;tis mine,&rdquo; said the Americans, &ldquo;by
right of purchase&rdquo;; &ldquo;&rsquo;tis mine,&rdquo; said the Spanish, &ldquo;by the claim
of Domingo Teran Del Rio of 1690.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so the Neutral Strip was established. Each nation begrudging
the other every inch of it. A lawless land which must
now be policed for the good of both nations.</p>
<p>The southwestern border of the United States was established
by the Adams-Onis Treaty at Washington on February 22, 1821,
as being the Sabine River; Adams representing the United States
and Onis representing the New Republic of Mexico.</p>
<p>Would the settlers of the Neutral Strip and those from the
Sabine River to the Rio Grande recognize the treaty of Washington?
The Gutierrez-McGee filibuster expedition had proved
that these people wished a new freedom. Not that of the United
States or that of Mexico. Many men had cast their eyes toward
the land of Texas, there was so much of it for the taking. But
the Indians were not just sitting on the sideline observing what
was happening, they were pressing for their rights, too, against
any and all nations. Surely they realized their prize possession
was slowly slipping from them. The Indians recognized no treaty
among the white men. Only the agreements with the whites
which concerned their welfare were of importance to them.</p>
<p>Many young adventurers of all nationalities and from all
walks of life had come into the area and found the excitement
to their liking. They would align themselves with the side which
offered them the most advantageous opportunities.</p>
<p>General Edmund P. Gaines found himself in a predicament
when he received orders on Dec. 21, 1819, to establish a new command
post near the border of the Sabine River. He was ordered
&ldquo;to establish a new post in a location that will protect our southwestern
border as well as all of the inhabitants within the boundaries
of the United States in your area.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<p>In the Southwest area he had federal troops under his command;
at New Orleans, 96 men under Major Many; at Baton
Rouge, 212 officers and men; at Fort Claiborne, Natchitoches,
56 men under the command of Major Coombs; and, at Camp
Sabine, on the Sabine River, 105 men under the command of
General Wilkinson.</p>
<p>On November 15, 1820, Lieutenant Colonel Zachary Taylor
and four Companies of the 7th United States Infantry had established
Fort Selden on the south bank of Bayou Pierre on the
highest hill in the area, one and one-half miles from the confluence
of Bayou Pierre with Red River, six miles north of
Natchitoches and three miles west of Grand Ecore. Taylor named
the Fort, &ldquo;Selden,&rdquo; in honor of Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Selden,
who fought in the American revolution and who was at
that time stationed in the Arkansas Territory.</p>
<p>From the vantage point of Fort Selden on Bayou Pierre
there was a one-mile view of the channel of the bayou. There
was flat-boat traffic on the bayou to the town of Bayou Pierre
and on northward to the Petit Caddos in the vicinity of the present
day city of Shreveport. Taylor was in position to control the
water traffic on the bayou.<a class="fn" id="fr_12" href="#fn_12">[12]</a></p>
<p>At Fort Selden Lieutenant Colonel Taylor received this message:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Special Order No. 19.
<span class="lr">Headquarters West Dept.,</span>

<p>Lieutenant Colonel Taylor with the troops under his
command, will as soon as possible, occupy the position at
Shields Springs, 25 miles south southwest of this place,
where he will canton the troops in huts of a temporary kind.
The buildings will be constructed by the troops. Supplies
necessary, will be sent by the Quartermaster.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Colonel Taylor is charged with the south

</blockquote>
<p>These two orders confirmed a previous order issued to Taylor
by Gaines in November of 1821 while he was in Arkansas&mdash;an
order to explore the vicinity of Natchitoches and the Neutral
Land and to locate a site for a cantonment of a permanent nature,
which would be nearer the Louisiana and Texas boundary.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Colonel Taylor selected the site and then wrote
to General Gaines informing him of his selection&mdash;on a hill which
was the division between the watersheds of the Red River and
the Sabine River. He went as far as he could to the west to
establish a permanent command post. Camp Sabine on Sabine
River which was established by General Wilkinson was not considered
a permanent position, but only an encampment for the
benefit of the United States Police Patrol established in the
Neutral Strip to police the Sabine River border and to look after
the safety of the settlers within the area known as The Neutral
Land.</p>
<p>General Wilkinson and his detachment were never entirely
successful in quelling the activities of the lawless element. Federal
troops stationed at Sabine Town or Camp Sabine or Sabine
Block-house (all one and the same site) had some 5000 square
miles of territory to patrol. A patrol at that time would have
consisted of ten mounted men and one officer. There were approximately
112 men and officers at Camp Sabine, and the
detachment post would have consisted of ten patrols. If all were
in activity at the same time each patrol would have had 500
square miles to patrol, which, of course, was an impossible task.
At this time there were about 50 men and officers in Natchitoches
at Fort Claiborne and even the two combined groups
would not have been adequate for policing such an enormous
area. The outlaws knew this and in the Neutral Strip the lawless
roamed and pillaged at will and remained hidden in its
thousands of hills and hollows.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that at the time of the battle of
New Orleans in 1815 General Jackson thought the Neutral Strip
frontier so important that he did not withdraw the troops from
that post to assist in the battle with the British.</p>
<p>In 1822 when Lieutenant Colonel Zachary Taylor established
a cantonment at Jesup at Shields Spring by the order of General
Edmund Pendleton Gaines, on the highest hill between the Sabine
River and the Red River, he had taken into consideration
the claim of Cavalier Robert de La Salle, when in 1682, this
Frenchman claimed all the land drained by that river for the
King of France. With the Louisiana purchase, which consisted
of all land claimed by France west of the Mississippi River, this
<span class="pb" id="Page_109">109</span>
would include the site of Cantonment Jesup on that hilltop. The
rainwater falling on the western slope would drain into the Mississippi
River via Bayou Adais and Bonna Vista into Bayou
Dupont to Little River to Bayou Pierre to the Red River and
thence into the Mississippi River. Waters falling on the western
slope would find the way to the Sabine River via Phillips Bayou
to Bayou LaNann, thence to the Sabine River. Thus, the establishment
of Cantonment Jesup at this particular spot had argumentative
value in favor of the United States against any outcome
of the melting-pot development which could arise west of
the Sabine River.</p>
<p>By November 9, 1822, the Quartermaster General&rsquo;s report
stated that the Federal militia was consolidated and located at
the Garrison Post at Baton Rouge, three hundred fifteen officers
and men of the First Infantry; and at Cantonment Jesup,
one hundred forty-one officers and men of four companies of
the seventh Infantry under the command of Lieutenant Colonel
Zachary Taylor.</p>
<p>1822 marked the end of the detachment at Sabine Town,
Fort Selden on Bayou Pierre, near Grand Ecore, Louisiana and
Fort Claiborne at Natchitoches, Louisiana.</p>
<p>When Mexico won her independence in 1821 the Empressario
System was continued and by the end of the year 1823, Stephen
Fuller Austin had executed the grant which had previously been
given to his father, Moses Austin, in which nearly three hundred
American families were allowed to settle in the Texas area.
Colonel James B. Many, Commandante at Cantonment Jesup,
was there to greet the emigrants on their way to Texas. The
same year General Gaines decreed that Cantonment Jesup would
be known as Fort Jesup, and made it a permanent establishment
of the Army of the United States Government, which resulted
in a more thorough settlement of the Sabine area known as the
Neutral Strip.</p>
<p>Shawneetown, two miles to the west of Fort Jesup on El
Camino Real, came into existence to supply the evil demands of
the immediate area&mdash;gambling, horse-racing and other auxiliaries
of dis-order.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<p>The twenty-five-mile house, or Midway House, two miles east
of Fort Jesup on the road to Natchitoches was a wayside tavern
and Inn.</p>
<p>By 1826 the Mexican Republic had forbidden further immigration
into Texas&mdash;the direct result of a contract which had
been acquired by Hayden Edwards to establish eight hundred
families in the Nacogdoches area. Here Edwards organized the
short-lived Republic of Freedonia which resulted from the Freedonia
Rebellion. Edwards was driven out of the Nacogdoches
area and his contract revoked.</p>
<p>In this same year a letter, originating at Fort Jesup, to the
Governor of Louisiana, appeared in the Natchitoches Courier,
one of the two newspapers published at Natchitoches at that
time, answering the President of the United States, who wanted
to know about the possibility of establishing steam navigation
on the Red River above the Town of Natchitoches. A duplicate
of the original, which sent to the President, was placed at the
disposal of the Natchitoches Courier. Colonel James B. Many at
Fort Jesup wished the local citizens of the area to know that the
personnel at Fort Jesup was useful in ways other than military.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="lr">The Natchitoches Courier</span>
<span class="lr">Fort Jesup</span>
<span class="lr">Natchitoches, Louisiana</span>
<span class="lr">March 13, 1826</span></p>
<p>Captain Berch and Lieutenant Lee with a detachment
of men from Fort Jesup, have been up the Red River examining
the great rafts of debris which block the channel
of Red River. This detachment returned a few days ago
after an absence on that duty of about two months. We
have conversed with these scientific and learned gentlemen
on the subject of their excursion, the object of which was
to ascertain the practicability of opening steamboat traffic
through or around these obstructions.</p>
<p>They report that in a distance of one hundred miles
above the Town of Natchitoches, there are 181 log jams,
ranging from ten yards in length to a distance of one-half
<span class="pb" id="Page_111">111</span>
mile. To clear these obstructions would be a tremendous and
expensive task.</p>
<p>I wish to be remindful that in as much as the Sabine
River which lies west of this place, usually maintains enough
water to afford its usage by steamboats. In these trying
times such as exists between ourselves and our neighbors
to the west, I think it advisable that such an excursion be
made up the Sabine River, for military if not to mention
commercial purposes.</p>

<p>John Baldwin with his wife and two daughters must have
established their store prior to 1826. The location of the Baldwin
Store marked the site of the later town of Many, Louisiana,
which derives its name from Colonel James B. Many. Baldwin&rsquo;s
Store, Tavern, Inn and Blacksmith Shop comprised the area of
the Stille home and the present sites of the Sabine State Bank
&amp; Trust Co., and The Peoples State Bank in Many.</p>
<p>During this period Manuel and Jose Chellettre operated the
&ldquo;Two Brothers&rsquo; Freight Line&rdquo; between Natchitoches and Nacogdoches.
Also at this time the firm of Barr and Davenport had
a freight line service between the same two destinations.</p>
<p>The newspaper also listed the names of the steamboats which
were vying for the Natchitoches-Texas trade: <i>The Florence</i>, <i>The
Superior</i>, <i>The Alexander</i>, <i>The Chesapeak</i>, <i>The Courtland</i>, <i>The
Eliza</i>, <i>The Governor Shelby</i>, <i>The Hornet</i>, <i>The Kiamechi</i>, <i>The
Plaquemine</i>, <i>The Raven</i>, <i>The Teche</i>, <i>The Telegraph</i>, <i>The Shepardess</i>
and <i>The Arkansas</i>.</p>
<p>Henry Stoker, having received a government land grant, had
by now established his home, and he enlarged his holdings by
trading eleven horses for land belonging to several families of
the Adais Indians who were living near his homestead.</p>
<p>Fort Jesup during its existence trained such men as Second
Lieutenant Phil Sheridan, Lieutenant Thomas Lawson, Captain
Bragg, Lt. L. B. E. Bonneville, Lt. James E. Goins, Captain
Davie E. Twiggs, Capt. J. Hardee, and Lt. Rufus Ingalls. These
men during the war between the states, became generals either
for the North or the South. Lieutenant U. S. Grant, who was
stationed at Camp Salubrity near Grand Ecore, was often a
visitor at Fort Jesup.</p>

<p>Such important men as David Crockett, James Bowie,
Stephen F. Austin and Sam Houston; and such famous scouts
as Ben S. Lilly and &ldquo;Big Foot&rdquo; Wallace visited there. Because
they were welcomed and entertained at Fort Jesup, accusations
were made by the Spanish that Fort Jesup was a meeting place
for those planning the overthrow of the Mexican government.
And this may very well have been true, for supplies necessary
for the conduct of the war for Texas independence undoubtedly
passed through Fort Jesup.</p>
<p>There is evidence that the United States did render secret
support to the fighting Texans in their struggle for independence.
This fort at such a strategic location could have blocked
revolutionary movements in this frontier area if it had chosen
to do so. Because of this Fort Jesup became recognized as the
heart of the Texas-Mexican revolution. The garrison at Fort
Jesup assisted by checking the border Indians of Louisiana, Arkansas
and northern Texas, who may have otherwise aided the
Mexican forces against the retreating Sam Houston just before
the Battle of San Jacinto.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">The Gaines Military Road</span>, 1827-1828</h3>
<p>The Military Road or The Gaines Military Road, sometimes referred
to as General Jackson&rsquo;s road, connected the two most
remote western outposts of the United States&rsquo; army, Fort Jesup
and Fort Towsin. This last was located at the confluence of the
Kiamechi River of Oklahoma and the Red River. The military
road was nearly three hundred miles long.</p>
<p>In 1831 Fort Jesup came under the command of Brevet Brigadier
General Leavenworth, with six companies of the Seventh
Infantry. In 1832 the garrison was increased to two hundred
ninety-six men and officers, and Colonel James B. Many again
assumed command.</p>
<p>It was during the command of Gen. Leavenworth that some
of the settlers or squatters that had moved into the area, some
within a half-mile distance of the Fort, made themselves objectionable
by selling whiskey to the personnel at Fort Jesup. In
order that the sale of whiskey near the fort might be stopped
the following order was issued:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<p>Order No. 69</p>
<p>To all whom it may concern:</p>
<p>Having received instructions from General Leavenworth
to take possession for the United States, for the purpose of
supplying fuel for the garrison, of all public land within
three miles of the flagstaff of Fort Jesup; all persons having
a &ldquo;donation or pre-emption&rdquo; claim are hereby ordered to
vacate the said premises immediately, or at the earliest
possible date, otherwise they will be dealt with according
to the law.</p>

<p>James Bowie, David Crockett and Sam Houston were entertained
at Fort Jesup by Colonel Many while en-route to cast their lot
with the Texans. To greet these men in Nacogdoches were
Thomas J. Busk, Frost Thorn, Adolphus Sterne, Charles S. Taylor,
Henry Raguet, Doctor Irion, John Drust and William C.
Logan, all of whom were to have a hand in winning the Texas
independence.</p>
<p>The municipality of San Augustine was organized in 1833,
and was the first town in Texas to be laid out on the American
plan of forty-eight blocks, consisting of three hundred fifty-six
feet with streets forty feet wide, and two lots in the center for
the Courthouse.</p>
<p>The history of San Augustine dates back to the very earliest
Texas history, with its location astraddle the El Camino Real,
previously the Buffalo Trail and then part of the Caddo Indian
trail system. Cabeza de Vaca passed this spot and later a scouting
party of the Hernando de Soto expedition. The Ais (Ayist)
Indians were there to greet the Domingo Teran Del Rios Expedition
and then the Domingo Ramone Expedition. The Ais Indians
of San Augustine were the first Texas Indians to establish trade
agreements with the French, when in 1708 the Frenchman, Bejoux,
began trading with them for horses.</p>
<p>San Augustine became a most important port of entry, second
only to Galveston. It may very well be called the Cradle of
Texas Independence for it is said that any man entering San
Augustine, be he French, Spanish or American, became a Texan.
Ninety percent of the men who engaged in the strife for Texas
independence had walked the streets of San Augustine.</p>

<p>The progress of the struggle for Texas independence was
watched with keenest interest throughout the United States, but
the interest south of the Mason-Dixon line was greater as most
of the Texas settlers came from the Southern states.</p>
<p>Louis Cass, the Secretary of War, on January 23, 1835, sent
instructions to Major General Edmund P. Gaines, ordering him
to move to a position nearer the western frontier of Louisiana,
and to assume personal command of the troops near the Mexican
(Texas) border. Blockhouses were erected to protect the supplies
of the personnel of the camp. General Gaines took personal
command of the troops there.</p>
<p>The Red River by the year 1835 had changed its course and
taken the Bayou Rigolet de Bon Dieux as its main channel, leaving
Natchitoches high and dry except during the spring and winter
months. The river port of Grand Ecore then became the most
important shipping port for the southwestern area of Louisiana
and eastern Texas. The Texas trail now by-passed Natchitoches
some four miles to the west, connecting it with Grand Ecore.</p>
<p>General Gaines wrote of the decaying condition of the buildings
at Fort Jesup, and acquired a twenty-five thousand dollar
appropriation for their repair through the help of Thomas S.
Jesup, Quartermaster General of the United States, who had
been given the honor of having Fort Jesup named after him.</p>
<p>General Gaines possessed a war-like nature and he nourished
the idea of annexing Texas in one blaze of glory for himself.
Further, he knew that President Andrew Jackson wanted Texas
as a part of the United States.</p>
<p>Gaines, in a letter to Cass, stated that B. F. Palmer and
William Palmer, living near Fort Jesup, had informed him that
a Spaniard had arrived at the house of one of their neighbors,
saying he had been commissioned by Santa Anna to go among
the Caddos and other upper Red River tribes of Indians and
stir them up into attacking the upper settlements of Texas.
<span class="pb" id="Page_118">118</span>
Gaines had sent Lieutenant Bonnel with Eusebia Cartinez, to
gain the good will of the Caddos without success. But they were
successful among the Indians further to the west of the Caddos.
They learned that Manuel Flores, who had established at Spanish-Town
between Fort Jesup and Natchitoches, won alliances
with the Caddos.</p>
<p>Enclosed in the letter were communications from Henry Raguet,
Chairman of the Committee of Vigilance at Nacogdoches
and A. Hotchkiss, Chairman of a similar committee at San
Augustine, both declaring that Indians had moved into the area
along El Camino Real and requesting an investigation.</p>
<p>Cass was informed that the Alamo had fallen and many of
the troops, including Fannin, were killed near Goliad on the
Madina River and that Sam Houston was in full retreat toward
the Louisiana border.</p>
<p>Gaines now received orders to use his own judgment about
the affairs on the frontier, and that if he had to go into the
Texas territory to insure the peace of the frontier, he could go
no further than Nacogdoches.</p>
<p>Gaines was still at Sabine Blockhouse when word came that
on April 18, 1836, Sam Houston had defeated Santa Anna at
San Jacinto Bay. Thus Gaines&rsquo; chance for glory was gone. However,
he must be credited with a timely move, when a few weeks
before he had ordered troops to Nacogdoches, thus spoiling the
counterpunch attempted by Santa Anna to stir up the Indians.
This, without a doubt, quelled the prospective uprising of the
Indians.</p>
<h3>TREATY WITH THE CADDO INDIANS</h3>
<p>In June, 1835, Colonel Many sent a contingent of soldiers to the
upper Red River country to lend assistance in the signing and
execution of the treaty between the United States and the Caddo
Indians. At the Caddo Indian Agency house, located on a bluff
overlooking Bayou Pierre, nine miles south of the present-day
city of Shreveport, was drawn an agreement with the Indians,
dated July 1, 1835:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<p>The Chiefs, Headmen and Warriors of the tribes of the
Caddo Nation of Indians, agree to cede and relinquish to
the United States all land contained in the following boundaries:
Bounded on the west by the North-south line which
separates Louisiana and the United States from the Republic
of Mexico and on the west by the Red River in the
Territory of Louisiana and Arkansas.</p>
<p>The Chiefs, Headmen and Warriors agree to relinquish
their possession of the land and agree to move out of the
boundaries of the United States at their own expense, and
never to return to live, settle, or establish themselves as a
nation or a community.</p>
<p>In consideration the Caddo Nation will be paid $30,000
in goods and horses as agreed upon and $10,000 to be paid
per annum in money, each year, for the four years following.
Making a whole sum of $80,000, paid and payable.</p>
<p>In Testimony Whereof, the said Jehiel Brooks, Commissioner,
the Chiefs, Headmen and Warriors of the Caddo
Nation, have hereunto set their hands and affixed their
seals.</p>

sons, then born and still living named, Jacques, Dominique
and Balthazar, in the year 1801, one league of land to each,
according to the Spanish custom. This being a total of four
square leagues of land.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Larken Edwards, being old and unable to work and having
been a steadfast friend of the Caddo Indians, was also given at
the request of the Indians, land which now comprises most of
the area of present day Shreveport, Louisiana.</p>
<p>On May 14, 1837, the following ad appeared in the Red River
Gazette, a Natchitoches newspaper:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A. W. P. Ussery has the pleasure to inform friends and
the public that he has taken the Fort Jesup Hotel and is
now ready for company. He has a commodious house and
stable and a delightful situation. In addition to the comforts
of the well regulated house, the weary traveler will be regaled
at night and morning by the delightful music of the
Fort Jesup Band.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With the ability of Texas to maintain her independence, Fort
Jesup settled down to the humdrum existence of a peaceful, frontier
post. In the summer of 1838 the garrison was reduced to
two companies of men and officers. In 1840 the third infantry
members at Fort Jesup were ordered to Florida. This left one
company of fourth infantry at Fort Jesup.</p>
<p>Texas threw open its doors to immigrants and daily these
passed through the Fort Jesup area, to travel El Camino Real
westward. Many, however, stopped in the Natchitoches-Sabine
country. Texans knew that immigrants represented power, power
to resist Mexico.</p>
<p>This peaceful existence was not to last long. There was talk
of the annexation of Texas by the United States which Mexico
did not want. For as long as Texas was a Republic there was
<span class="pb" id="Page_121">121</span>
a possibility that Mexico might recover this prize possession, a
possession which also included the present states of New Mexico
and a part of Wyoming.</p>
<p>As early as 1843 the United States was contemplating acquiring
Texas as a state. In the meantime they had purchased the
territory of New Mexico, Utah, Nevada and Wyoming from
Texas which did not set well with the Republic of Mexico. There
was a kind of cold friendship existing between the United States
and Mexico.</p>
<p>Late in 1843 General Zachary Taylor was ordered to the
Texas-Louisiana frontier, thus early in 1844 there came to Fort
Jesup the Army of Observation.</p>
<p>Camp Salubrity was established three miles west of Grand
Ecore on the Texas Road May 18, 1844, where the fourth infantry
companies were encamped. One of the young officers was
Lieutenant U. S. Grant.</p>
<p>On May 18, 1845, General Taylor at Fort Jesup received a
letter marked &ldquo;Confidential&rdquo; from Secretary of War, Marcey.
This secretly and officially marked the beginning of the disposition
of troops and the laying of plans for the war with Mexico.
Marcey wrote, &ldquo;I am directed by the President to cause forces
now under your command and those which may be assigned, to
be put into position where they may most promptly act in the
defense of Texas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At Fort Jesup under the command of General Taylor were
seven companies of the Second Dragoons and eight companies
of the Fourth Infantry. Four companies of the Fourth Infantry
were stationed at Camp Salubrity.</p>
<p>Texas expressed a desire at the July 1845 session of the
Texas Congress to become a State of the Union.</p>
<p>General Taylor at Fort Jesup received instructions to place
the Troops under his command in the Army of Observation in
such locations that would be most advantageous to render support
to Texas if such an occasion should arise.</p>
<p>The Mexican conflict seemed inevitable and Taylor ordered
Camp Salubrity abandoned and the Companies of Infantry there
boarded steamboats at Grand Ecore for New Orleans along with
<span class="pb" id="Page_122">122</span>
three companies of the four companies of the 4th infantry which
were stationed at Fort Jesup.</p>
<p>This July 1845 Report from Fort Jesup explains the removal
of the Troops from Fort Jesup and those who remained:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>July 17, 1845, The 3rd Infantry under the command of
Lt. Col. Hitchcock left this post for the point of embarkation
for New Orleans.</p>
<p>July 25, 1845, The 2nd Dragoons under the command
of Colonel Twiggs left this post for Texas Via the Texas
Trail. On this day Lt. Zill P. Inge assumes command at
Fort Jesup.</p>
<p>There remains at this Post, and all present accounted
for the following: One Company of the 4th infantry and
one company of the 2nd Dragoons. The names of these men
appear on the July 31, 1845, Daily Report.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>On November 29, 1845, the Adjutant General ordered that
Fort Jesup was no longer required as a military post, all military
supplies, buildings and land be disposed of.</p>
<p>Thus Zachary Taylor when a Lt. Col. executed the order to
establish Fort Jesup and 23 years later as a Brigadier General
executed the order to abandon it.</p>
<p>Ironic as it may seem, Fort Jesup brought law to a lawless
land. It was a buffer zone through which passed softly, those
intent on a new kind of freedom. It was the mould which shaped
the southwestern section of these United States.</p>

<p>In 1816 the United States Land Office sent representatives to
Natchitoches, although previously representatives had been in
Natchitoches in 1806 to register land claims within the Neutral
Strip area. Proof was demanded of people settling land in the
Neutral Strip, referring to either French or Spanish grants.</p>
<p>In 1730 Zavallez, then Governor of Los Adais, granted three
square leagues of land to Manuel Sanchez on Los Pedro Creek
(Bayou Pierre), the grant was listed as La Nana de Los Rio
Pedro. (Note: The wife of St. Denis was a Sanchez, her mother
being Maria Esperrillo Sanchez before her marriage to Don
Diago Ramone). The Sanchez Grant is also referred to as Los
Tres Llanos (Three Plains) was approved again in 1742 by
Governor Larros in the name of Governor Winthusin. The son
of Manuel Sanchez was eighty two years of age when in 1832
a clear title was issued by the United States Land Office. The
Sanchez family had lived on the land 102 years before they obtained
a clear title to it.</p>
<p>Juan de Mora was granted one league square of land on
Bayou Dupont at Los Adais by Zavallez which is the land located
in an area known today as &ldquo;Fish Pond Bottom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Testimony of Gregoria Mora before the land office officials
shows: &ldquo;This is a receipt of tithes I collected on land west of
the Calcasieu River, West of Bayou Kisachey and west of Arroyo
Hondo. Also west of Bayou Pedro (Bayou Pierre) dated in Nacogdoches,
Feb. 27, 1797, and signed by Jose Maria Guadiana

<h3><span class="sc">Claim of Pedro Dolet, Frenchman</span> (Pierre Dole)</h3>
<p>On December 29, 1795, I, Jose Cayetano de Zepede, executor
to Los Adais and by request of Antonio Gil y Barbo Governor of
Texas at Nacogdoches, went with my assistant, Don Jose de La
Vega to a place at Los Adais, where a petitioner had built a

<h3><span class="sc">Claim of Edward Murphy</span></h3>
<p>Don Edwardo Murphy, petitioner from the post at Natchitoches,
states that on a creek La Petit St. Jean and Reo Hondo
I find advantageous to collect my cattle, I humbly ask of you to
give me possession of this land.</p>
<p>Nacogdoches, October 17, 1791. In consequence of petitioner
and that the land solicited is in the province of Texas and vacant
I do grant in due best form and that it may so appear.</p>

<h3><span class="sc">Claim of Edward Murphy for the Firm of Murphy, Smith, Barr and Davenport</span></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Edward Murphy, Leander Smith, William Barr,
Samuel Davenport. (District Judge William Murray
heard the plea of the Firm of Murphy, Smith, Davenport
and Barr).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>August 1, 1798, Don Jose Guadiana, Governor at Nacogdoches,
granted to Don Edward Murphy a grant of land named
&ldquo;La Nana Prairie&rdquo; located seven leagues east of the Rio Sabinas
on the road to Natchitoches, 144 sections of land astraddle El
Camino Real (a 12 square mile land grant, extending eastward
from Bayou Lana and could have very well taken the townsite
of Many, Louisiana. Murphy transferred this land to the above
mentioned firm, November 3, 1798).</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Claim of Michel Crow</span></h3>
<p>Michel Crow, son of Isaac Crow, who wed the widow Chabineau
of the Post at Natchitoches, bought the land of Miguel
Viciente which has been granted to Miguel Viciente in 1769 by
Governor Hugo O&rsquo;Connor, who was at that time Governor of
<span class="pb" id="Page_132">132</span>
Los Adais and all of the Texas country. The grant was listed
as San Miguel de Los Rio Patrice and was located on the Sabine
River and Patrice Creek in the northwest portion of Sabine
Parish.</p>
<p>One incident in which an arrest and the results of which
served as evidence in favor of the victim occurred while Lieutenant
Zebulon M. Pike was in command of a police patrol of the
Neutral Strip in 1806, when he arrested Michel Crow and
brought him to the post at Natchitoches, accusing him of contraband
operations to and from the Texas country. Captain
Bernardino Mantero, leading a Spanish patrol with the assistance
of Lieutenants Pike and McGee, came to the ranchero of
Michael Crow and upon questioning Crow&rsquo;s wife and her two
sons, learned of the actions of Lieutenant Pike previously. Captain
Mantero went to Natchitoches and declared that Crow was
innocent of such charges and that the unfortunate Crow was
only engaged in farming and ranching; further the Spanish did
not have Crow&rsquo;s name on the list of traders in contrabrand
known to the Spanish at Nacogdoches, thus, when Michel Crow
registered his claim for land, he had proof of the length of time
he had resided there taken from the arrest papers.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Claim of the Heirs of Widow Tontin</span></h3>
<p>In 1791 Anthanase De Mezieres granted to Julian and Pierre
Bisson land called Ecore Rouge (Red Hill) located at the present
day hamlet of Allen between Robeline and Powhattan, Louisiana,
one hundred ninety square arpents of land on each side
of Topelcot Bayou. The widow Tontin, nee Possiot, wed Julian
Bisson (Note: The store at Allen and the home of Leroy&mdash;Dobber&mdash;Anderson
are located atop Ecore Rouge).</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Claim of the Heirs of Anthanase Poissot</span></h3>
<p>In 1792, Anthanase De Mezieres, Governor of the Texas region
at Natchitoches Post, granted land to Anthanase Poissot
in recognition of his claim of having bought the land of La Tres
Cabanes (Three Cabins) from Chief Antoine of the Hyatasses
(Yatassee Indians) on Bayou Pierre.</p>

<h3><span class="sc">Claim of the Firm of Murphy, Smith, Davenport and Barr</span></h3>
<p>The Los Ormegas Land Grant of Jacinto Mora contained two
hundred seven thousand three hundred sixty acres bordering on
the east bank of the Sabine River and astradle El Camino Real.
The grant was issued by Jose Cayeleno de Zepeda, Governor at
Nacogdoches and was sold to the above mentioned firm in 1805.
The land was transferred under the title of Santa Marie Adelaide
Ormegas, but was not recognized by the United States Government
until 1842.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Claim of the Heirs of Pierre Gainnie (Pedro Gane) (Pier Gagnier) Hipolite Bordelon Francois Grappe (Francisco Grebb) (Franquis Grebbe)</span></h3>
<p>These three men bought the land of the Chescher Indians
(The area comprises the Mibermel Ranch near Powhattan, Louisiana,
and the area of Three League Bayou or Nine Mile
Bayou).</p>
<p>This grant was recognized by Anthanase DeMezieres of the
Post at Natchitoches.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Families of the Neutral Strip</span> (1805)</h3>
<p>Records of Diago Maria Morfil, representing the Spanish of
that area, in lieu of Jacinto Mora, directive of the Governor at
Nacogdoches of the Texas Region, presented this record of families
considered under the jurisdiction of Presidio Neustra
Senora Del Pilar de Los Adais to the United States Land Agents
in 1816:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">134</div>
<dl class="undent"><dt>Don Marcelo de Soto, farmer, wife, Dona Maries Baillio, Frenchwoman, two sons, two daughters, resided on Los Pedro Creek (Bayou Pierre).</dt>
<dt>Pedro Lafita, Spanish, wife, Louise Gainnie, Frenchwoman, resided on Bayou Los Tres Leagues.</dt>
<dt>Luis Beltran, Frenchman, resided on Rio Hondo (Young&rsquo;s Bayou) or Bayou La Jeune. (Unmarried)</dt>
<dt>Vincente Rolan, Frenchman, wed Melanie Vascoque, Frenchwoman, residing on Bayou Durange. (This bayou drains Cypress Swamp and empties into Topelcot Creek, also known as Cypress Swamp, Hall Break area, north of Marthaville, Louisiana).</dt>
<dt>Don Antainse Possiot, Frenchman, wed to Juanna Elena Pabi, Frenchwoman. Note: This is the Anthanase Poissot who bought land from the Chescher Indians on Three League Bayou, which extended westward to Bayou Pierre.</dt>
<dt>Michael Rambin, Frenchman wed to Theresa Baillio (Theresa Baillio, sister to Maria Baillio who wed Marcelo De Soto) resided on Los Pedros Creek (Bayou Pierre). There was one hired hand on this farm, Jose Crafon, Spanish.</dt>
<dt>Jean Balbado, Frenchman wed to Lenore Tessier, Frenchwoman, resided on Arroyo Hondo (Hagewood or Coldwater vicinity between Robeline and Natchitoches, Louisiana).</dt>
<dt>Jean Tessier, Frenchman and widower, resided in the same area as above.</dt>
<dt>Louis Fortin, Frenchman, wed to Manuella Aragon, Spanish, resided on land of Francois Prudhomme which was among the Adais Indians, at Los Adais.</dt>
<dt>Francisco Prudhomme, Frenchman wed to Anne Marie Rambin, Frenchwoman, two sons and seven daughters. Prudhomme in 1805 was 74 years old. This land among the Adais Indians was granted to Prudhomme by DeMezieres in 1771. Francois Prudhomme was a trader among the Indians and at the same time had a Spanish co-partner, Antonio Gil y Barbo, who traded among the Spanish along El Camino Real. Manuel Flores was another partner of Prudhomme, also Miguel Viciente who later sold his grant to Isaac Crow. It is very likely that Viciente at his out of the way home on Sabine River was a trader in contraband merchandise supplied by Prudhomme. The trail leading from Sabine River and the home of Miguel Viciente on Bayou San Patrice and eastward to the Red River via Converse, Pleasant Hill and to Bayou Pierre was a contraband trail. In 1723 Paul Muller established Post du Bayou Pierre, with contraband trade with the Spanish as his aim. Post du Bayou Pierre developed into the Town of Bayou Pierre. This trail was traveled by Gutierrez and his followers when they were pursued by the Royalists, Spanish Troops.

<h2 id="c24"><span class="h2line1">PERSONALITIES</span></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>(The names with stars are descended from early ancestors
mentioned in the text or listed in the early records
of El Camino Real area)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here are some short biographies of individuals who have each
in his or her own way contributed to the progress of our El
Camino Real upper territory.</p>
<p>Many of them are descendants of the earliest settlers, and
their families have been in Louisiana for nearly 250 years. Very
few in Louisiana can claim such distinction, for even the founders
of New Orleans came later.</p>
<p>The families of others written about here settled in this area
years afterward, some in modern times. But they have adopted
the land as their own and are just as proud of its history and
traditions as the &ldquo;old timers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All have, by living up to the standard of older days, added
to the well being of the community and improved it socially, economically
and politically. They have made it attractive to tourists
and visitors, and new permanent residents find it a most attractive
place in which to live. The people of today who live along
El Camino Real are worthy of their sires.</p>

Stockman, a School teacher and State Representative of Sabine
Parish. The Toledo Bend Dam, one of his pet projects, shall some
day prove its value to this Louisiana and Texas area. Mr. Ammons&rsquo;

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
